Abstract
Three experiments identified factors that did and did not enhance the formation of           two-node four-member equivalence classes when training and testing were conducted with           trials presented in a trace stimulus pairing two-response (SP2R) format. All trials           contained two separately presented stimuli. Half of the trials, called within-class           trials, contained stimuli from the same class while the other half, called cross class           trials, contained stimuli from different classes. On within class trials, making a              YES  response was correct and making a  NO  response was           wrong. On cross class trials, making a  NO  response was correct and making           a  YES  response was wrong. In Experiment 1, similar intermediate           percentages of participants (about 50%) formed classes, regardless of whether           the responses were labeled  YES  and  NO  or            SAME  and  DIFF . Response labeling thus did not influence           class formation. Regardless of response labels, failures of class formation were primarily           due to failure of class-indicative responding produced by within-class transitivity           probes. In Experiment 2, only 50% of participants formed classes without prior           training, as in Experiment 1, but 100% of participants formed equivalence           classes after the establishment of a generalized transitivity repertoire by use of a           programmed transitivity induction protocol. Experiment 3 examined two components of the           programmed transitivity induction protocol and found that the exclusion of AC trials had           no effect on the percentage of participants who formed equivalence classes, while           presenting the stimulus sets in randomized order interfered with equivalence class           formation. A further analysis found that a number of stimulus control topographies           differentiated between individuals who did and did not form equivalence classes. In           general, then, these experiments demonstrate that equivalence classes can be formed           reliably when training and testing are conducted in an SP2R format, supporting the view           that equivalence class formation can account for the development of conceptual categories           in natural settings.

In complex human behavior, responses often generalize among stimuli that bear no physical       resemblance to each other. When this occurs, the stimuli are said to be symbolically related       to each other, and this presumed symbolic relation is used to account for the transfer of       responding among the stimuli. In other words, the above-mentioned stimuli have become members       of an equivalence class, which in turn acts as a function-transfer network for the response in       question. The establishment of equivalence classes and the function-transfer property acquired       by such classes have been used to account for many complex performances that are indicative of       meaning  and syntax         ( ;  ;          ;  ), among other things. Equivalence class formation, then, has come to carry a       significant explanatory burden in behavior analytic accounts of complex human behavior ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ,          ;  ).
In real world settings, equivalence classes would have to be formed by most people in a wide       variety of training and testing formats and classes would necessarily vary in size and nodal       structure . Thus, laboratory-based demonstrations of equivalence classes that vary in size       and structure, that can be formed with the training and testing trials presented in a variety       of formats, and that are formed by most participants in a study would strengthen the       explanatory strength of an equivalence-based account of complex human behavior.
Typically, equivalence class research has used one format for both training and testing:       matching-to-sample (MTS) . Unfortunately, since many of these studies have not       shown particularly high yields (the percentage of participants in a group who formed classes),       the use of MTS procedures, per se, does not ensure reliable equivalence class formation. The       reliability of equivalence class formation has been substantially increased by the use of: (a)       particular preliminary training strategies ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ,  ); (b) the programming of training and testing       during class formation itself ( ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ); (c) the       topographies of the responses used to select comparison stimuli ; and (d) the       content of the stimuli used as members of the potential equivalence classes ( ;  ). These       strategies, then, have provided format-specific support for an equivalence-based analysis of       complex human behavior. Demonstrations of reliable equivalence class formation that use trials       presented in a variety of formats can further expand the strength of such an analysis.
In recent years, a number of studies explored the formation of equivalence classes in which       training and/or testing were conducted using trial formats other than MTS. One such approach       employed training that used trials presented in a respondent-type format ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ), also called       a stimulus–stimulus pairing format . Using this procedure,       stimulus pairs from the same set were presented without any response required from subjects to       either stimulus. In these trials, the presentation of the two stimuli might overlap, as in       Pavlovian delayed conditioning. Alternately, there might be a short interstimulus interval       between the offset of the first stimulus and the onset of the second stimulus, as in Pavlovian       trace conditioning.
Using respondent type training, researchers have trained participants to form two 3-member       classes (A1–B1–C1 and A2–B2–C2) by the       establishment of AB and BC relations, with the presentation of A1 followed by B1, B1 followed       by C1, A2 followed by B2, and B2 followed by C2. Tests for class formation, however, were       measured in an MTS format; differential responding to the stimuli on emergent relations probes       were used to document the formation of the equivalence classes.
Respondent type training has resulted in a wide variation in yields (20 to 100%).       Based on relatively small groups (3 through 8 participants), however, the reliability of these       yields is questionable. Regardless, these middling yields provide only a modest increment to       the explanatory strength of an equivalence-based account of the establishment of complex human       behavior (see   for       additional comment). In addition, the variability of these empirical outcomes implies that       relatively little is known about the parameters needed to establish equivalence classes       reliably with respondent type training.
Another format, referred to here as the stimulus pairing two-response or SP2R format, has       also been used to establish equivalence classes. SP2R trials differ from respondent type       trials in several ways. Trials can contain pairs of stimuli from either the same potential       class, called within-class trials, or different potential classes, called cross-class trials.       In addition, SP2R trials require a participant to make one response for within-class trials       (e.g.,  YES ) and another response for cross-class trials (e.g.,        NO ). To illustrate, two 3-member classes (A1–B1–C1       and A2–B2–C2) could be established by training the baseline relations       (AB and BC) using within-class trials (A1 → B1, B1 → C1, A2       → B2, and B2 → C2) and cross-class trials (A1 → B2, A2       → B1, B1 → C2 and B2 → C1). Because this procedure       establishes different responses to within- and cross-class relations, the same procedure can       be used to track the emergence of derived relations. For example, after training AB and BC,       the emergence of the CA equivalence relations can be assessed with the within-class trials C1       → A1 and C2 → A2 and the cross-class trials C1 → A2 and C2       → A1. The evocation of the  YES  response by the within-class       probes and the  NO  response by the cross-class probes would document the       emergence of the CA equivalence relation. Similar outcomes obtained with all emergent probes       would document the formation of two ABC equivalence classes.
The two responses mentioned above could be denoted with labels other than        YES  and  NO , such as  SAME/DIFFERENT  or          RELATED/UNRELATED , with arbitrary symbols, or with manipulanda that are       identical in appearance but differ with regard to position. Another variation would be a       go/no-go contingency in which a response must occur within a certain time during one type of       trial while the same response must not occur during the other type of trial ( ;  ). In yet a third       variation, called a blank-comparison procedure, two stimuli are presented as sample and       comparison along with one other stimulus that is called the blank comparison ( ;  ;  ). If the two       stimuli are from the same class, the correct response is pressing the class-based comparison       stimulus. If the two stimuli are from different classes, the correct response is pressing the       blank comparison stimulus. Because the variations in these procedures reside in the two       response options, we refer to all of them generically as SP2R procedures. Elsewhere, the SP2R       format has also been referred to as a successive matching-to-sample procedure ( ;  ), and the precursor to       the relational evaluation procedure (pREP) .
The use of SP2R procedures has resulted in a wide variation in yield, raising questions about       the parameters needed to induce equivalence classes reliably ( ;          ). The following three experiments identified some       variables that influenced the reliability of equivalence class formation using trials       presented in an SP2R format. Experiment 1 explored the effects of different response labels on       the formation of equivalence classes. Experiment 2 explored the effects of a programmed       transitivity induction procedure on the subsequent formation of new equivalence classes.       Experiment 3 identified two parameters of the programmed transitivity procedure that are       responsible for its efficacy. A further detailed analysis identified differences in responding       evoked by various baseline relations and emergent relations for participants who did and did       not form equivalence classes. It also suggested how the programmed transitivity induction       protocol influenced the emergence of these stimulus control repertoires.
EXPERIMENT 1: EFFECT OF RESPONSE LABELS
 reported         that the likelihood of class formation under the trace SP2R format was influenced by the         labels that denoted the two response options in a trial. In their research, 5 of 5         (100%) participants formed four 3-member equivalence classes when the response         options were labeled  SAME  and  DIFF , but only 2 of 4         (50%) participants did so when the response options were labeled          YES  and  NO . Using the  YES  and          NO  labels,   similarly found that only 60% of subjects formed equivalence         classes under a trace SP2R format. Experiment 1 determined whether the substitution of            SAME / DIFF  response labels for  YES/NO          labels in the procedure used by   would increase the yields in equivalence classes.
Method
Participants
Twenty-six undergraduate students recruited from the Psychology 101 subject pool at             Queens College/CUNY participated in the study for partial fulfillment of the course             requirement. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, producing two             groups of 13 participants. Each participant had up to 3 hr to complete all training and             testing. All participants read and signed informed consent documents before the start of             the experiment. Participants had no formal knowledge of equivalence classes and had not             participated in any studies of equivalence class formation.
Apparatus
This experiment was conducted on an IBM-compatible microcomputer attached to a 38.1 cm             monitor and a standard keyboard. The training and testing procedures were controlled             with custom software that programmed all stimulus presentations and recorded all             responses. The stimuli were presented in 5-cm × 5-cm square areas on the             computer. The vertical positioning of the stimuli is described below. The stimuli used             in this experiment are set forth in  . In the symbolic designations, the lower case  w  and                n  designate the stimuli as words (i.e.,  w ) or             nonsense syllables (i.e.,  n ). The members of the stimulus sets used in             probing for the formation of equivalence classes were the nonsense syllables              LEQ ,  HUK ,  POV , and              BAF , which corresponded to the A1n, B1n, C1n, and D1n stimuli,             respectively, and  MEV ,  GUQ ,  ZOJ , and                YAR , which corresponded to the A2n, B2n, C2n, and D2n stimuli,             respectively. Stimulus sets 3 and 4 were used during trial familiarization training. Set             3 contained the words  Eggs  (A3w) and  Bacon  (B3w) and             the nonsense syllables  KAV  (C3n) and  PUC  (D3n), and             set 4 contained the words  Star  (A4w) and  Comet  (B4w)             and the nonsense syllables  MOX  (C4n) and  SIF  (D4n).

Procedure

Experimental design 
Experiment 1 was a group design that determined whether the labels that designated               the two responses in SP2R trials influenced the percentage of participants in a group               who formed equivalence classes. In Condition I, the 1 and 2 keys were covered with               tabs on which were printed  YES  and  NO , respectively.               In Condition II, the 1 and 2 keys were covered with tabs on which were printed                  SAME  and  DIFF , respectively. Although the               following procedures are described with the  YES/NO  response options,               the procedures described were used with both conditions.

SP2R trials: content and feedback 
Each phase of the experiment that used an SP2R format contained within- and               cross-class trials. When feedback was provided, a correct response was followed by the               presentation of the feedback message  RIGHT  and an incorrect response               was followed by the presentation of  WRONG . In trials that were not               scheduled to provide informative feedback,                —E—  was presented, which indicated the end of               the trial.

Temporal and positional parameters of stimuli in SP2R trials 
The SP2R trials were presented in different temporal and positional configurations in               various phases of the experiment. The first and second stimuli are referred to as the               sample and comparison, respectively. The stimuli were horizontally centered on the               computer screen while their vertical positioning varied with the trial format. When               trials were presented in a delayed SP2R format, the sample was displayed above the               comparison with the bottom edge of the sample stimulus 3 cm above the upper edge of               the comparison stimulus. A trial began with the presentation of a sample stimulus.               After making an observing response (one press of the spacebar), a comparison stimulus               was displayed, and both stimuli remained on the screen until the participant pressed               the 1 or 2 key. Either response terminated both stimuli and resulted in the               presentation of the feedback stimulus, as described above.
When trials were presented in a trace SP2R format, the observing response terminated               the sample stimulus and, following a 0.1-s interval, the comparison was then displayed               and remained on until the subject pressed the 1 or 2 key. In some phases that used the               trace SP2R format, the comparison was presented below the sample, as in a delayed SP2R               trial. In other phases, the comparison was presented in the same location as the               sample stimulus. The temporal and positional parameters of the trace SP2R trials were               the same as those used in the successive matching-to-sample trials described by  .

Block structure, mastery criteria, and feedback 
Every stage of the experiment was divided into phases. Each phase contained a block               of trials that served a particular behavioral function or combination of functions.               The trials in a block were presented in a random order without replacement. Both               training and derived relations test blocks were repeated until all of the trials in a               block produced 100% accurate responding (mastery) or for a given number of               repetitions. The blocks used to establish new conditional discriminations were               conducted with all trials in a block producing informative feedback. Once mastery was               achieved, the relations were maintained in blocks where informative feedback was               presented for a decreasing percentage of trials in a block. Typically, feedback was               reduced from 100% to 75% to 25% to 0%               in successive blocks as long as the mastery level of responding was maintained. If               mastery was not achieved at a given level of feedback, the participant was reexposed               to the feedback percentage at the prior, higher level, and then again provided with               the feedback percentage used in the previously failed block. This back-up procedure               was repeated until mastery was achieved at all levels of feedback. This feedback               reduction and back-up procedure is referred to hereafter collectively as Standard               Feedback Reduction.

Trial familiarization training 
The experiment began with trial familiarization training, which was designed to teach               participants how to respond to each of the stimuli presented in a trial. In addition,               it was designed to establish conditional discriminative control while systematically               shifting the parameters of a trial from a delayed SP2R format to a trace SP2R format               with all stimuli presented in the same location.
The 10 phases of trial familiarization training are set forth in  . In all phases, trials were presented in the SP2R               format. Phases 1–5 used the A and B stimuli in sets 3               ( EGGS  and  BACON ) and 4 ( STAR  and                  COMET ), respectively. The stimuli in each set were semantically               related to each other to maximize the establishment of conditional discriminations.               Symbolically, training was conducted with Aw → Bw relations. In Phases               1–3, the sample and comparison stimuli were presented in a delayed format               with the sample appearing above the comparison. These three phases contained varying               levels of prompts to maximize the production of correct responding. In Phase 1, full               prompts were given, so that the prompt “ study cue press               spacebar ” was presented below the sample stimuli and the prompt                  “press Yes or No”  was presented below the               comparison stimuli. In Phase 2, partial prompts were used; “ study                 and press ” was presented beneath each sample stimulus and                 “ Yes No ” was presented beneath each               comparison stimulus. In Phase 3 and all subsequent phases, no prompts were provided.               The mastery level of responding in Phase 3 demonstrated that responding was under the               conditional discriminative control of the sample and comparison stimuli.
In Phase 4, the sample and comparison stimuli were presented in a trace mode, with               the comparison stimulus still displayed below the sample. Phase 5 was identical to               Phase 4 except that the comparison stimuli were now presented in the same position as               the sample stimuli. Phase 6 was identical to Phase 5, except that the comparison               stimuli (which had been B1w and B2w) were now replaced with C stimuli (which were               nonsense syllables, denoted as Cn). Symbolically, training was conducted with Aw               → Cn relations. Phase 7 was identical to Phase 6, except that the words               that had been used as the sample stimuli (Aw) were now also replaced with nonsense               syllables (Dn). Symbolically, training was conducted with Dn → Cn               relations. Phases 1 through 7 all provided participants with 100%               feedback. Phases 8–10 were identical to Phase 7 except that the percentage               of trials in a block that occasioned feedback was systematically reduced using the               Standard Feedback Reduction procedure outlined previously.
To summarize, trial familiarization training was designed to transfer control exerted               by semantically related stimuli (Aw → Bw) presented in a delayed stimulus               pairing format to control exerted by conditional relations between meaningful and               arbitrary stimuli (Aw → Cn) and two arbitrary stimuli (Dn →               Cn), both of which were presented in a trace stimulus pairing format. In addition,               trial familiarization training also induced maintenance of these relations in the               absence of informative feedback. Although successful training established linked               conditional discriminations that yielded the training structure Dn → Cn               ← Aw → Bw, no probes were presented to evaluate the emergence               of any relations that could be derived from the stimuli in these sets.

Equivalence class formation 
At the completion of trial familiarization training, participants attempted to form               new equivalence classes. Trials were presented in a trace SP2R format with samples and               comparisons in the same location. As listed in  , the procedure began with the establishment of AB conditional               discriminations by the presentation of both within-class and cross-class trials with               100% informative feedback. Acquisition of the AB relations was complete               when responding reached 100% accuracy. Once acquired, the block of AB               trials was repeated but the percentage of trials in a block that produced informative               feedback was reduced using the Standard Feedback Reduction procedure. Once the AB               conditional discriminations were maintained in the absence of informative feedback,               the symmetrical relation between A and B was evaluated with the presentation of B1               → A1 and B2 → A2 within-class probes, along with the B2               → A1 and B1 → A2 cross-class probes. All of these probes, as               well as all subsequently presented emergent relations probe trials, were presented               with no informative feedback. Next, trials were presented to establish the BC               conditional discriminations, again using the Standard Feedback Reduction procedure.               Thereafter, the symmetrical property of the B and C stimuli was assessed with CB               symmetry probes. After passing the CB test, subjects were presented with a block of               trials that contained a combination of within- and cross-class AB, BC, BA, and CB               trials. Class-consistent responding in this test block confirmed the maintenance of               all relations when presented together.
Having established the necessary baseline relations, participants were then presented               with blocks containing probes to assess the emergence of the various derived               relations. Each of these blocks was presented with no informative feedback.               Participants were first probed for the emergence of transitivity through the               presentation of the within-class and cross-class AC probes. Next, the emergence of               equivalence relations was assessed with the presentation of within-class and               cross-class CA probes. Although the formation of 3-member classes would be documented               by mastery levels of responding in all of the probes mentioned above, these derived               relations were assessed in isolation. The next block examined whether class indicative               responding would be maintained if all possible within- and cross-class trials were               presented in randomized order within a single block, which was called the 3MIX test               block. This block was repeated up to three times or until performance reached the               mastery criterion. Mastery level responding during the 3MIX test block confirmed the               formation of two 3-member classes.
After participants passed the 3MIX test, the 3-member classes were expanded to two               2-node 4-member classes by training CD and then maintaining CD during Standard               Feedback Reduction. Expansion of class size was tested through the presentation of a               4MIX test block that contained all possible baseline, symmetry, transitivity, and               equivalence probes. Symmetry was evaluated using the within-class and cross-class DC               probes. The emergence of one-node transitive relations was assessed with within-class               and cross-class BD probes. The emergence of the two-node equivalence relations was               assessed with within-class and cross-class DA probes.

Generalization to delayed matching-to-sample 
The last phase of the experiment evaluated the maintenance of the four-member               equivalence classes with a single test block that contained trials presented in a               two-choice delayed matching to sample (DMTS) format. This test block was preceded by               the presentation of the following instructions:
PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ANY KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD YET. In this part of the experiment,                 many new trials will be presented. Each trial will now contain THREE nonsense words                 you've seen before. First, ONE will appear at the TOP of the screen, then TWO will                 appear at the bottom. Your task is to select the BOTTOM word that goes with the TOP                 word. Initial trials will also include instructions that tell you which keys to                 press. These instructions will eventually disappear. Thank you for your               cooperation!
The test block itself contained all of the baseline conditional discriminations and               the emergent relations probes. As illustrated in  , each relation was presented on two trials. All trials began with               a sample stimulus from one of the two classes. An observing response resulted in its               termination, followed in 0.1 s with the concurrent presentation of a pair of               comparison stimuli, one from each class. For a given pair of comparisons, their left               and right positions were balanced across trials. Both comparisons were displayed until               one was selected by pressing the 1 or 2 key to choose the comparison on the left or               right, respectively. Selection of a comparison resulted in the presentation of the                  – E –  message. Mastery in this test block               (at least 94% of trials evoking class-consistent comparison selection)               indicated the maintenance of the two equivalence classes and generalization to a new               trial format.
Results and Discussion

Effect of response labels 
 illustrates the number               of participants who began and completed each stage of the experiment. Shortly after               the experiment began, 3 participants dropped out of the experiment leaving 13 in the                  SAME/DIFF  group and 10 in the  YES/NO  group. Two               3-member equivalence classes were formed by 6 of 13 (46%) participants in               the  SAME/DIFF  condition and 7 of 10 (70%) participants in               the  YES/NO  condition, a difference that was not significant (Fisher's               exact test,  p   =  .40). When all               participants were considered, three-member equivalence classes were formed by 6 of the               13 (46%) and by 7 of the 13 (54%) participants who began the               experiment in the  SAME/DIFF  and  YES/NO  conditions,               respectively. Once again this difference was not significant (Fisher's exact test,                  p   =  .70). Regardless of               metric, the differences in the effects of the response labels did not influence               likelihood of forming three-member equivalence classes. For participants in both               groups, if the three-member classes were formed, class size inevitably expanded to               four members. Those participants who continued on then demonstrated class indicative               performances in the final DMTS test.
Number of participants in the  YES/NO  and                    SAME/DIFF  groups (Conditions I and II) in Experiment 1 who began                   each condition (total height of each bar), who completed each condition (white                   portion of each bar), and who did not complete each phase of the condition (gray                   portion of each bar). The phases used in each condition were preliminary training                   (TFT), three-member class formation (3M), maintenance of three-member classes                   (3MIX), expansion of class size from three to four members (4MIX), and maintenance                   during a delayed matching-to-sample test (DMTS). When the height of a bar to the                   right of an adjacent bar is lower than the adjacent bar, the difference is due to                   subjects dropping out of the experiment between conditions.
               reported that the likelihood of equivalence class formation was much greater when               responses were labeled  SAME  and  DIFFERENT  (4 of 4)               instead of  YES  and  NO  (0 of 4). These results were               not replicated in the present experiment, nor did response labels influence class               expansion or maintenance of class indicative performances in different trial format.               Rather, both sets of response labels produced similar and moderate yields, which also               were similar to those reported by  . These results demonstrate that the high yield produced               using the  SAME/DIFFERENT  response labels, as reported by  , was               discriminatively or contextually limited to the presence of some factors in their               experiment that were absent in the present experiment. The identification of the               variables responsible for making class formation differentially sensitive to response               labels will await outcome of future research.

Effect of instructions on class maintenance in DMTS tests 
As noted above, all participants who formed three-member classes successfully               expanded the classes to four members. Finally, class indicative responding generalized               immediately and with no training to relations in the four-member classes that were               presented in two-choice DMTS format. As noted in the Method section, the instructions               for the DMTS transfer test were minimal. Thus, the virtually instantaneous               generalization of class-indicative performances to DMTS trials attests to the format               independence of the baseline relations that were trained and the derived relations               that had emerged in the trace SP2R format.

Transitivity and failure of equivalence class formation 
For the 6 of 10 participants who did not form the equivalence classes, the failures               were largely due to performances evoked by the transitivity probes. Although               participants correctly made the  NO  response when presented with the               cross-class A1–C2 and A2–C1 probes, they also made the same                  NO  response when presented with the within-class A1–C1               and A2–C2 probes. This finding replicated that reported by  . By               implication, then, the prior induction of a transitivity repertoire that would be               active during class formation ought to increase the likelihood of class formation.               This notion is addressed in the remaining sections of this article.
EXPERIMENT 2: EFFECT OF PROGRAMMED TRANSITIVITY INDUCTION
Experiment 2 determined whether the prior induction of a generalized transitivity         repertoire would increase the likelihood of equivalence class formation. Condition I of         Experiment 2 replicated the procedures used in Experiment 1, where a minimal form of         preliminary training preceded an attempt to establish equivalence classes using trials         presented in the trace SP2R format. Condition II, by contrast, began with a highly         programmed preliminary training procedure designed to induce a generalized transitivity         repertoire, after which participants attempted to establish new equivalence classes, as in         Condition I. Greater yields in Condition II than I would indicate that the prior induction         of a generalized transitivity repertoire enabled individuals to form new equivalence         classes.
Method
Participants
Thirty undergraduate students were recruited, from the same subject pool and meeting             the same requirements as those in Experiment 1, and were randomly assigned to one of two             conditions, producing two groups of 15 participants. Unexpected dropouts between             recruitment and participation in Experiment 2 resulted in 15 and 11 participants in             Conditions I and II, respectively. Each participant had up to 3 hr to complete all             training and testing.
Apparatus
The hardware and software were the same as those used in Experiment 1. The stimulus             sets used in Experiment 2 are listed in  . As in Experiment 1, stimulus sets 1 and 2 were used in the             equivalence class probes for both conditions. Stimulus sets 3 through 10 were used             during programmed transitivity induction. Sets 3 and 4 contained three semantically             related English words. Sets 5 and 6 each contained three words and three nonsense             syllables. Sets 7 through 10 each consisted of three nonsense syllables. The stimuli in             sets 5 through 8 in the present experiment were not used in Experiment 1.

Procedure

Preliminary training: Condition I 
The participants in Condition I began the experiment with the same trial               familiarization training procedure used in Experiment 1.

Preliminary training: Condition II 
Condition II began with exposure to the programmed transitivity induction (PTI)               protocol. It consisted of an amalgam of procedures, each of which was known to               facilitate the formation of a variety of stimulus control topographies. These were (a)               training with many stimulus sets ( ;  ;                  ;  ;  ;                  ;  ; (b) the gradual changing of the stimuli across               sets, which has been dubbed stimulus programming ; (c) trial-unique training consisting of the presentation of transitivity               probes with direct reinforcement instead of testing under extinction conditions ; and (d) the               establishment of a network of multinodal stimulus relations ( ;  ).
 shows each phase of the programmed               transitivity protocol. Phases 1 through 6 involved a trial-unique procedure in which               all relations were directly trained through the presentation of informative feedback               on all trials. All phases involved the presentation of a block of training trials that               was repeated until no more than one error occurred in a block (the mastery level of               responding).
Phase 1 trained participants to respond appropriately to the stimuli presented in               each trial. This phase used stimulus sets 3 and 4. To maximize acquisition, the three               stimuli in each set contained words that were all semantically related to each other:               A to B, B to C, and A to C. Set 3 consisted of  Eggs  (A3w),                  Bacon  (B3w), and  Toast  (C3w). Set 4 consisted of                  Star  (A4w),  Comet  (B4w), and  Moon                (C4w). After training  Eggs → Bacon  (A3w →               B3w) and  Star → Comet  (A4w → B4w), training               continued with  Bacon → Toast  (B3w → C3w) and                  Comet → Moon  (B4w → C4w). Then the               transitive relations  Eggs → Toast  (A3w → C3w)               and  Star → Moon  (A4w → C4w) were directly               trained in a block that also contained the prerequisite AB and BC relations. Phases 2               through 5 established a generalized transitivity repertoire with a new set of stimuli:               those in sets 5 and 6. Each stimulus set contained six stimuli – three               words and three nonsense syllables – but only three stimuli from each set               were used in any given phase. As each phase was mastered, the next phase contained               trials that incorporated only one change in the parameters that defined the new phase.
In Phase 2, the stimulus sets contained three common English words. Set 5 contained                  Lion  (A5w),  Tiger  (B5w), and                Stripe  (C5w), and Set 6 contained  Milk  (A6w),                  Cookie  (B6w), and  Oven  (C6w). In each set, a               semantic relation existed between the first and second word, and between the second               and third word, but not between the first and third word. After acquiring  Lion                 → Tiger  (A5w → B5w),  Milk →                 Cookie  (A6w → B6w),  Tiger → Stripe                (B5w → C5w), and  Cookie → Oven  (B6w               → C6w), participants were given transitivity training with  Lion                 → Stripe  (A5w → C5w) and  Milk →                 Oven  (A6w → C6w).
Phase 3 used two previously used words from each set and one new stimulus that was a               nonsense syllable. Thus, one set contained  Lion  (A5w),                Tiger  (B5w), and  HUV  (D5n) and the other contained                  Milk  (A6w),  Cookie  (B6w), and  HET                (D6n). After training the new conditional discriminations  Tiger →                 HUV  (B5w → D5n) and  Cookie → HET                (B6w → D6n), participants were given  Lion →               HUV  (A5w → D5n) and  Milk → HET  (A6w               → D6n) training, a transitive relation between a word and a nonsense               syllable.
Phase 4 used one of the previously used words, the previously used nonsense syllable,               and a new nonsense syllable. Thus, the stimuli in one set were  Lion                (A5w),  HUV  (D5n), and  BON  (E5n), and in the other               set were  Milk  (A6w),  HET  (D6n), and                ZIS  (E6n). Training continued with  Lion →               HUV  (A5w → D5n) and  Milk → HET  (A6w               → D6n), while also establishing the new conditional discriminations                  HUV → BON  (D5n → E5n) and  HET                 → ZIS  (D6n → E6n), the first conditional               discriminations between two nonsense syllables. Once mastered, participants were               presented with  Lion → BON  (A5w → E5n) and                  Milk → ZIS  (A6n → E6n), each a potential               transitive relation between a word and a nonsense syllable.
Phase 5 used the two previously used nonsense syllables from each set and added a new               nonsense syllable. The stimuli in one set were  HUV  (D5n),                BON  (E5n), and  BEW  (F5n), and in the other set were                  HET  (D6n),  ZIS  (E6n), and  MAR                (F6n). Training continued with  HUV → BON  (D5n               → E5n) and  HET → ZIS  (D6n-E6n), while               establishing the new conditional discriminations  BON →               BEW  (E5n → F5n) and  ZIS → MAR  (E6n               → F6n), which were additional conditional discriminations between two               nonsense syllables. Thereafter, participants were presented with  HUV                 → BEW  (D5n → F5n) and  HET →               MAR  (D6n → F6n), the second potential transitive relation that               consisted of two nonsense syllables. To summarize, Phases 2 through 5 established sets               of six stimuli that were linked by training and could induce the four transitive               relations Aw → Cw, Aw →Dn, Aw → En, and Dn               → Fn.
Phase 6 used the new stimuli in sets 7 and 8. Each set contained three nonsense               syllables:  GAZ  (A7n),  NOS  (B7n), and                ZOX  (C7n) in one and  WAP  (A8n),  RUP                (B8n), and  JUS  (C8n) in the other. After training the relations                  GAZ → NOS  (A7n → B7n) and  WAP                 → RUP  (A8n → B8n), the procedure continued with the               training of  NOS → ZOX  (B7n → C7n) and                  RUP → JUS  (B8n → C8n). Finally, training               was conducted for the two potential transitive relations,  GAZ →                 ZOX  (A7n → C7n) and  WAP → JUS (A8n                 → C8n) . These were the fifth potential transitive relations and               were also the second pair of potential transitive relations that consisted of two               nonsense syllables. The immediate emergence of transitivity in Phases 2–6               was demonstrated by responding that was at least 88% accurate during the               first block in a phase that contained the trials in a potential transitive relation.
Phases 7 through 9 used two new stimulus sets, each containing three nonsense               syllables. Set 9 contained  VIN  (A9n),  BER  (B9n), and                  SOL  (C9n), while set 10 contained  PEX  (A10n),                  YUT  (B10n), and  MOS  (C10n) for the other. Except               where otherwise noted, all trials produced informative feedback.
Phase 7 began with a block that trained the AB relations, which was repeated until no               more than one trial in the block evoked an incorrect response (mastery). The next               block trained the BC relations but also included AB trials, which again was repeated               until mastery was achieved. Thereafter, the block containing AB and BC trials was               repeated, this time using the Standard Feedback Reduction procedure described in               Experiment 1. The next block presented contained the four AB and four BC trials along               with eight AC trials. Informative feedback was not presented for any of the trials in               this block, which assessed the emergence of the transitive relations, AC. If more than               one trial in this block evoked an incorrect response, the block was repeated with all               trials producing informative feedback until the mastery level of responding was               produced by the trials in the block. Mastery of this block, with or without feedback,               resulted in advancement to the next phase of programmed transitivity induction.
Phase 8 was identical to Phase 7, except that the sample and comparison stimuli,               which until now had been presented using a delay format, were now presented in a trace               format with the sample and comparisons presented in different locations.
Phase 9 was identical to Phase 8, except that the two stimuli in a trial were               displayed in the same location. Mastery of Phase 9 signaled completion of the               programmed transitivity induction procedure, at which point participants were placed               into the equivalence class formation portion of the experiment, which was identical to               the equivalence class formation probe used in Experiment 1.
Results and Discussion

Trial familiarization training 
All participants in Condition I completed trial familiarization training.

Programmed transitivity induction 
All participants in Condition II completed the programmed transitivity induction               protocol. The emergence of transitive relations was measured with the performances               evoked by the blocks that contained transitivity trials. These data are presented in                  , where different               columns present the data for the AC relations in Phase 1, the AC, AD, BD, and DF               relations in Phases 2–5, and the AC relations in Phases 6 and 7. Data for               individual participants were presented in sets of rows separated by a blank row. The               successive rows indicate repetition of the same block, until mastery. Each cell               indicates the number of blocks needed to respond correctly on at least seven of the               eight trials in a block. The immediate emergence of a transitive relation was               demonstrated by responding correctly on at least seven of the eight trials in the               first presentation of a block for a given transitivity probe.

Each column is for a separate phase. The transitive relation in the                   phase is indicated in a letter-letter format. The shaded cells contain data that                   can indicate the emergence of transitive relations. Cells that contain numbers                   followed with an ‘a’ were conducted with uninformative                   feedback. Cells with numerals not followed with an ‘a’                   were shown with informative feedback. Cellular entries in bold font indicate                   emergent transitive relations. Cellular entries in normal font do not indicate the                   emergence of transitive relations. See text for more information.
In Phase 1, all of the potential transitive relations produced correct responding in               the first block. Since the stimuli in these sets were all semantically related to each               other prior to the start of the experiment, these performances did not document the               emergence of transitive relations.
In Phases 2 through 7, up to six different transitive relations could emerge: four in               Phases 2 through 5 (Aw → Cw, Aw → Dn, Aw → En, and               Dn → Fn), one in Phase 6 (An → Cn), and one in Phase 7 (An               → Cn). Transitive relations were demonstrated in all six cases by 5               participants (44, 50, 43, 49, and 51), in five cases by 2 participants (48 and 47), in               four cases by 3 participants (46, 45, 52), and in three cases by 1 participant (53).               For all 11 participants, then, transitive relations were demonstrated in at least               three of the probes.
A generalized transitivity repertoire is demonstrated when transitive performances               are immediately evoked by many different transitivity probes. Condition II provided 66               opportunities to evaluate transitive relations (6 cases × 11               participants). Immediate emergence was demonstrated in 54 of the 66 cases. Thus, the               programmed transitivity induction protocol induced generalized transitivity               repertoires. In the remaining 12 cases, the “transitive”               relations did not emerge in the first block but rather were directly trained.
The stimuli used in Phase 7 were also used in Phases 8 and 9. Thus, performances in               the latter phases did not assess the emergence of transitive relations. Instead, they               evaluated the effects of format changes on the maintenance of previously emergent or               trained relational responding. Transitivity-indicative responding was maintained with               a change from a delay to a trace SP2R format with stimuli presented in different               locations, and then with a change of comparison location with trials presented in the               trace SP2R format. These performances, then, documented the stability of the               transitive relations when challenged with a number of changes in trial format.

Likelihood of equivalence class formation 
The top panel of                 illustrates the likelihood of equivalence class formation following trial               familiarization training in Condition I. All 15 participants completed trial               familiarization training. Seven participants did not form classes: As in Experiment 1,               virtually all of the within- and cross-class AC trials evoked the  NO                response. The 8 remaining participants formed three-member equivalence classes,               maintained class-indicative responding during the 3MIX test, expanded class size from               three to four members, and maintained class-indicative responding during the DMTS               test.
Number of participants in Conditions I and II of Experiment 2 who began each                   condition (total height of each bar), who completed each phase (white portion of                   each bar), and did not complete each condition (gray portion of each bar). The                   phases of the experiment in each condition were preliminary training (TFT for                   Condition I and Programmed Transitivity Induction (PTI) for Condition II),                   three-member class formation (3M), maintenance of three-member classes (3MIX),                   expansion of class size from three to four members (4MIX), and maintenance during                   a delayed matching-to-sample test (DMTS). When the height of a bar to the right of                   an adjacent bar is lower than the adjacent bar, the difference is due to subjects                   dropping out of the experiment between conditions.
The bottom panel of                 illustrates the likelihood of equivalence class formation after the completion of               programmed transitivity induction in Condition II. All 11 participants who began PTI               formed generalized transitivity repertoires. After the completion of PTI, 2               participants dropped out. The 9 remaining participants then formed three-member               equivalence classes, after which 1 participant dropped out. The remaining 8               participants then showed the expansion of class size from three to four members, and               the maintenance of the classes during the DMTS test.
A comparison of the data in the upper and lower panels of   illustrates the effects of PTI on the               subsequent formation of new equivalence classes. Two 3-member equivalence classes were               formed by 53% of participants after trial familiarization training and by               100% of participants after PTI. The likelihood of this difference in yield               occurring by chance is .02 (Fisher Exact test). Therefore, the induction of a               generalized transitivity repertoire by the PTI procedure enhanced equivalence               formation when training and testing were conducted in a trace SP2R format.
For both groups, all participants who formed three-member classes and remained in the               experiment expanded class size from three to four members and maintained class               indicative responding during the DMTS test. Thus, while the programmed transitivity               induction influenced the formation of the initial three-member equivalence classes it               did not influence the expansion of class size or the maintenance of the expanded               classes when tested with an alternate trial format.
EXPERIMENT 3: COMPONENT EFFECTS OF PROGRAMMED TRANSITIVITY INDUCTION
Experiment 2 demonstrated the efficacy of the PTI protocol. Because the PTI protocol is         rather complex, its efficacy could be attributed to any of the procedural components in the         protocol. Experiment 3 was designed to identify how the enhancement of equivalence class         formation was influenced by two of the components of the PTI procedure. One component         entailed training with stimulus sets that were introduced in a progression that varied         systematically from sets of three semantically-related words to sets of three nonsense         syllables. Another component involved the direct training of potential transitive relations         in each phase of the protocol. Experiment 3 explored the effects of each of these         components.
Experiment 3 consisted of three experimental conditions. In Condition I, participants were         exposed to a streamlined version of the PTI protocol, which included both the systematic         ordering of stimulus sets and the direct training of transitive relations. In Condition II,         participants were exposed to the same streamlined version of the PTI procedure except that         this version did not include, and thus did not directly train, the transitive relations. In         Condition III, participants were exposed to the same streamlined version of the PTI         procedure used in Condition I, except the ordering of the stimulus sets was random instead         of being systematic. After each form of preliminary training, all participants attempted to         form equivalence classes, using the same procedure that was used in Experiments 1 and 2.         Differences in the likelihood of forming equivalence classes were used to determine the         effect of the variables that distinguished the protocols in Conditions I and II, and I and         III. Finally, the programmed transitivity induction protocol used in Experiment 2 had a         number of procedural redundancies that may not have influenced its efficacy. In Experiment         3, those redundancies were eliminated. A comparison of yields across Experiments 2 and 3         would determine the impact of the removed components on the efficacy of the programmed         transitivity induction protocol.
Method
Subjects
Twenty-two undergraduate students from the same subject pool and meeting the same             requirements as those in Experiment 1 were recruited and randomly assigned to one of             three different conditions. Each participant had up to 3 hr to complete all training and             testing.
Apparatus
The hardware and software were identical to those used in the prior experiments.
Stimuli
As in the previous experiments, this experiment used both words and nonsense syllables             as stimuli. The stimulus sets used in Experiment 3 are in   and correspond to the stimulus sets used in             Condition II of Experiment 2. As in Experiments 1 and 2, stimulus sets 1 and 2 were used             in the equivalence class probes for all conditions. As in Experiment 2, stimulus sets 3             through 10 were used during programmed transitivity induction.
Procedure

Experimental design 
Each condition began with a different form of the programmed transitivity induction               (PTI) procedure used in Condition II of Experiment 2. Once completed, participants in               all conditions were exposed to the same follow-up condition, which was identical to               that used in Experiment 2: the formation of three-member equivalence classes, testing               for the maintenance of the three-member classes, expansion of the three-member classes               to four-member equivalence classes, and testing for the maintenance of the classes               when using a delayed matching-to-sample transfer procedure.

Condition I 
In Condition I, participants were placed in a streamlined version of the programmed               transitivity induction procedure that had been used in Condition II of Experiment 2.               The phases for this condition are set forth in  . Specifically, Experiment 3 removed the repetition of the               Standard Feedback Procedure, used in each of Phases 7 through 9 of Experiment 2, so               that participants did not experience feedback reduction until the final stage of PTI.               Additionally, because feedback was not reduced during those phases where the               positional and temporal parameters of the stimulus presentation were changed,               participants only experienced a single procedural change in each phase of PTI in               Experiment 3. Phases 1 through 6 were identical to those used in the prior experiment.               Phase 7, however, introduced the trace presentation of stimuli in different locations               and did not include any feedback reduction procedure such as had been used in               Experiment 2. Phase 8 then introduced the trace presentation of stimuli in the same               location, again without any feedback reduction such as had been used in Experiment 2.               In Phase 9, the temporal and positional changes from Phases 8 and 9 remained, but now               were accompanied by the feedback reduction procedure, wherein feedback was decreased               using the same Standard Feedback Reduction procedure used in Experiments 2 and 3. The               same stimulus sets (9 and 10) were used in each of these phases and were the same as               those used in Phases 7 through 9 of the prior experiment.

Condition II 
Preliminary training was the same as in Condition I except no AC trials were included               in the PTI protocol.

Condition III 
In Condition III, participants were presented with an unsystematic version of the               streamlined PTI procedure used in Condition I. In Condition III, the stimulus sets               were introduced in the randomized sequence illustrated in  .

Equivalence class formation 
Upon completion of the appropriate PTI procedure, or after 90 min if the participant               had not completed all the phases of the procedure, all participants were probed for               the formation of equivalence classes that used the same procedure and stimulus sets               used in the Experiments 1 and 2.

Delayed matching-to-sample transfer test 
Upon the successful establishment of the 4-member equivalence classes, subjects were               then placed into the DMTS transfer test, which was identical to that used in the prior               experiments.
Results and Discussion

Performances during preliminary training 
All 7 participants completed the streamlined programmed transitivity induction               protocol used in Condition I.   presents performances evoked by the transitivity trials in each phase of that               protocol. Immediate emergence of a transitive relation was demonstrated by responding               correctly on at least seven of the eight trials in the first presentation of the block               for a given transitivity probe. In Phase 1, all of the potential transitive relations               produced correct responding in the first block. In Phases 2 through 7, which contained               six different transitive relations, transitive relations were demonstrated in all six               cases by 3 participants (3302, 3296, and 3279), in five cases by 3 participants (3299,               3295, and 3280), and in three cases by 1 participant (3276). Thus, all participants               demonstrated transitive relations in at least three of the probes. Of the 42               opportunities to evaluate transitive relations (6 blocks × 7               participants), immediate emergence was demonstrated in 36 cases. Thus, the streamlined               PTI protocol induced generalized transitivity repertoires for all participants. In               general, then, these results are very similar to that obtained in the prior               experiment. Analogous data were not analyzed for participants in Condition II because               no transitivity probes were included in the protocol, nor in Condition III because               only one participant completed preliminary training.

Likelihood of equivalence class formation 
 illustrates the number               of participants who started and completed each phase of the experiment in Conditions               I, II, and III. Preliminary training was completed by 100% (7 of 7)               participants in Condition I, which utilized the basic PTI procedure that included               transitivity probe trials, by 88% (7 of 8) of participants in Condition               II, where transitivity probe trials were removed from the protocol, and by               14% (1 of 7) of participants in Condition III, where the phases of the PTI               procedure were presented in a randomized order.
 illustrates the                   number of participants who started and completed each phase of Experiment 3 in                   Conditions I, II, and III. The format of this figure is like that used for   and  .

Unnecessary components of the PTI protocol 
As illustrated in  , all 7               participants in Condition I formed three-member equivalence classes, expanded class               size from three to four members, and demonstrated the maintenance of the equivalence               classes when assessed in the DMTS format. These yields were equivalent to those               observed in Condition II of Experiment 2. Therefore, the components that were removed               from the PTI protocol, namely the repetition of the Standard Feedback Reduction               procedure, did not influence the efficacy of the PTI protocol.

Role of transitivity probes 
Condition II utilized the PTI protocol that did not include potential transitive               relations trials. The 7 participants who completed this form of preliminary training               formed three-member equivalence classes and expanded class size to four members. One               of the 7 participants was excused due to time constraints. The remaining 6               participants successfully completed the DMTS transfer test. The one participant who               did not complete the preliminary training failed to form three-member equivalence               classes and was then dismissed. The yields after Conditions I and II were equivalent.               Thus, the inclusion of transitive relations trials in the PTI protocol did not               influence the efficacy of that protocol.

Ordering of stimulus sets 
In Condition III, the systematic progression of stimulus sets was removed from the               PTI protocol. Only 1 of the 7 participants in this condition completed preliminary               training. Thereafter, that participant formed three-member equivalence classes,               expanded class size to four members, and maintained class indicative responding during               the DMTS test. The 6 participants in Condition III who did not complete preliminary               training also failed to form three-member equivalence classes and were dismissed. The               yields in Condition III were much lower than those obtained in Condition I. Therefore,               systematic ordering of stimulus sets in the programmed transitivity induction protocol               was a strong determinant of the efficacy of the PTI protocol.
It is not clear, however, what parameters of the ordering of phases and the stimuli               used across phases were critical for the enhancement of subsequent formation of               equivalence classes. That could be determined by studying the effects of a number of               variations of the PTI protocol. These could include variation in the ordering of               phases while holding constant the stimuli included in each phase, holding the logical               ordering of the phases constant with a manipulation of the stimulus sets across               phases, or by varying the number of phases holding order constant.
CROSS-EXPERIMENT ANALYSIS OF EQUIVALENCE CLASS FORMATION
The analyses presented above in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 identified variables that         influenced likelihood of equivalence class formation, but did not provide a detailed         characterization of performances engendered by each phase of training and testing during         class formation. That information is provided in the present section for the participants of         Experiments 2 and 3. Because the procedure used in Experiment 1 was replicated in Condition         1 of Experiment 2, information is not provided separately for Experiment 1.

Performances during the emergence of equivalence classes 
 presents the               performances in each phase of training and testing during the establishment of the               three- and four-member equivalence classes and during testing under the DMTS               condition. The panels in the left and right columns show data for participants who did               and did not form equivalence classes, respectively.
Blocks to mastery in each phase of equivalence class formation for participants                   who did and did not form equivalence classes are shown in the left and right hand                   columns, respectively. The data included in a given panel were averaged for all                   participants included in the condition. The abscissae for all graphs indicate the                   phases used during equivalence class induction. AB1, AB2, AB3, and AB4 refer to                   training conditions in which feedback was provided for 100%,                   75%, 25%, and 0% of the trials in a block,                   respectively, and likewise for the training of the other baseline relations. Data                   in each row are for different conditions in Experiments 2 and 3 and are indicated                   by the labels in the rightmost section of each row. The N values in each panel                   indicate the number of participants from whom data were included in the averages.                   The error bars indicate +/− 1 Standard Error (SE). The                   absence of an error bar means that all participants performed in the same manner                   during that phase. See text and tables for further information.
Data in the two top rows are for participants in Experiment 2. The first row presents               data for the participants who received trial familiarization training (Condition I)               while the second row presents data for the participants who received PTI (Condition               II). The third, fourth, and fifth rows present data for the participants in Experiment               3, Conditions I, II and III, respectively.
From these data, several general observations can be made. Data for participants who               formed equivalence classes were similar, regardless of the form of preliminary               training. Data for participants who did not form equivalence classes were likewise               similar, regardless of the form of preliminary training. Data for participants who did               and did not form classes, however, showed many differences.
The following commonalities were observed for participants who formed equivalence               classes, as shown in  .               First, all of the baseline relations were established in few training blocks,               demonstrating rapid acquisition. Second, the baseline relations were maintained with               reductions of feedback. That is, the conditional discriminative control exerted by the               baseline relations was resistant to disruption. Third, immediate emergence occurred               for all derived relations probes. Fourth, class consistent responding emerged               immediately during the generalization test with probes presented in a DMTS format.               Finally, there was a minimal amount of intersubject variation, as evidenced by the               very small standard error bars. These findings were obtained for 33 participants.
Among participants who did not form equivalence classes, the following commonalities               were observed. First, the AB baseline relations were acquired in few training blocks               regardless of condition, but the acquisition of the BC relations took many more               blocks. In addition, the emergence of the symmetrical relations occurred on a delayed               basis for participants who did not form classes, and these participants also required               additional blocks to master the mixed test of symmetry. Finally, no participant who               failed to form equivalence classes successfully passed the transitivity probe. These               findings were obtained for 14 participants.
A comparison of the performances for the participants who did and did not form               classes illustrated the following differences. Those who did not form classes required               many more blocks to acquire the BC baseline relations. They also required many blocks               to master both the symmetry and mixed symmetry probe, while the symmetrical relations               emerged on an immediate basis for the participants who formed classes. Finally,               participants who did not form equivalence classes failed to pass the transitivity               tests, whereas all participants who formed classes passed these tests, demonstrating               essentially immediate emergence.
These comparisons suggest that the programmed transitivity induction procedures               induced a range of stimulus control topographies. The differences between those who               formed classes and those who did not indicates that exposure to the programmed               transitivity induction protocol established stimulus control repertoires that enabled               the rapid acquisition of new conditional discriminations, resisted disruption of               baseline relations in the face of feedback reduction, and promoted the immediate               emergence of symmetrical and transitive relations.

The NO responding evoked by within-class transitivity probes 
In each of the experiments, when a participant failed to form equivalence classes,               the failure usually involved the evocation of the  NO  response by the               within-class transitivity probes instead of the correct  YES  response.               This occurred along with the correct evocation of the  NO  response by               the cross-class transitivity probes. Two theoretical accounts that could explain this               phenomenon are considered next.
First, according to the standard view, the A1 and C1 stimuli would be linked through               training of the within-class baseline relations A1–B1 and               B1–C1. Since both of the relations occasioned the reinforcement of the                  YES  response, the A1–C1 probe should also have evoked               the  YES  response. Contrary to expectations, for some participants the               within-class transitivity probes evoked the  NO  response. This outcome               could be explained by assuming that the A1 and C1 stimuli were linked by the               cross-class baseline relations A1–B2 and B2–C1, both of which               shared B2, the nodal stimulus from the other class. Since both of these relations               occasioned reinforcement of the  NO  response, the A1–C1               probe would also evoke the  NO  response. This source of stimulus               control, then, would have interfered with the subsequent formation of new equivalence               classes. Currently, however, these distinctions cannot be made empirically because the               present experiments did not provide a means of tracking the baseline relations that               were being attended to while solving the within-class transitivity probes.
This account is also challenged when applied to the mediation of performances evoked               by the cross-class probes. If the within-class transitivity probes were mediated by               attention to the two cross-class baseline relations, a similar process should also               account for the evocation of the  NO  response by the cross-class               transitivity probes. For example, A1–C2 could be mediated by               A1–B2 (which occasioned reinforcement of the  NO  response)               and B2–C2 (which occasioned reinforcement of the  YES                response). Thus, the A1 → C2 probe should evoke the  YES                and  NO  responses with equal likelihood. Instead, cross-class               transitivity probes consistently evoked a  NO  response. This outcome,               then, is not explained by the above analysis, though it might be explained by the               theory that the  NO  response is reliably evoked by a transitivity               probe if at least one of the linking baseline relations reinforced the                NO  response. Regardless of this alternative, the proposed explanation               for the evocation of the incorrect  NO  responses by the within-class               transitivity probes does not also account for the correct evocation of the                NO  responses by cross-class transitivity probes. The theoretical               account, then, does not provide a consistent explanation of the responses that were               evoked by within- and cross-class transitivity probes.
Finally, this account is challenged by the results of Conditions I and II in               Experiment 3. If this theory were correct, one would expect that participants who               received direct training of the within-class transitive relations would perform better               than those who did not receive such training. As discussed previously, however, this               was not the case. Participants in Condition II showed immediate emergence of the               transitive relation on within-class probes, correctly responding  YES                on these trials. This indicates that even without direct training of A1 →               C1 and A2 → C2, these relations were mediated by the within-class baseline               relations.
A second possible explanation for the incorrect  NO  response on               within-class transitivity probes could be that the  NO  response evoked               by both the within- and cross-class transitivity probes indicated that the stimuli had               not been presented together during prior training. This interpretation was proposed by                  , and               has received partial support from verbal reports of some participants during               postexperimental interviews. If true, the failure of transitivity, then, would have               been caused by inadvertent control of the  NO  response by novel               combinations of stimuli in a trial rather than the absence of a transitivity               repertoire. By implication, then, the programmed transitivity induction protocol would               have been effective because it taught participants to use the  NO                response to indicate membership of stimuli in the different classes, and suppressed               its use to indicate novelty of the stimulus pairs. Accordingly, the protocol enhanced               the subsequent formation of new equivalence classes by the elimination of a stimulus               control topography that interfered with control of behavior by class-based stimulus               control topographies. Finally, this analysis suggests that class formation could also               be enhanced, perhaps to equal degree, with a preclass formation protocol that would               directly train participants to use the  NO  response for its               experimenter-intended purpose, absent the induction of a generalized transitivity               repertoire. This account receives indirect support from the results of Condition II in               Experiment 3 where preliminary training did not include the presentation of               transitivity trials and thus did not provide direct training of transitive relations.
To summarize, these theoretical accounts suggest that failures of class formation               were due to unexpected stimulus control repertoires that interfered with class-based               performances evoked by transitivity probes and thus the formation of equivalence               classes. In addition, the results of Experiment 3 suggest that the efficacy of the               preliminary training protocol was not produced by the inclusion of transitivity               training, but rather by the systematic ordering of stimulus sets in that protocol and               the linkage of stimulus sets by nodal stimuli. Indeed, these latter manipulations               probably taught participants to attend to within-class relations when responding to               within-class transitive and equivalence relations probes and to cross-class relations               when responding to cross-class transitive and equivalence relations probes, and thus               to respond in a manner that reflected control of behavior by class membership.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
The results of the experiments as a whole have implications for three general issues: (a)         the reliability of equivalence class formation, (b) the format independence of relations         among stimuli in equivalence classes, and (c) the explanatory power of an equivalence-based         analysis of complex human behavior. Each is discussed in order.

Reliability of equivalence class formation 
Matching-to-sample is the most commonly used format for training and testing when               attempting to establish equivalence classes. When using an MTS format, early research               found that the reliability of equivalence class formation was rather variable. Many               more recent studies have found that the likelihood of class formation was               substantially improved by the incorporation of a variety of particular training and               testing strategies and response topographies in the procedures used to form classes,               such as those mentioned in the Introduction.
The results of the present experiments paint a similar picture for equivalence class               formation when trials are presented in a trace SP2R format. Under some preliminary               training conditions, the likelihood of class formation was modest while other               preliminary training conditions very reliably resulted in class formation. Regardless               of trial format, then, appropriate prior training can substantially enhance the               likelihood of equivalence class formation.

Format independence of equivalence classes 
All of the participants in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 who formed equivalence classes,               then immediately demonstrated class-indicative responding when equivalence class               relations were probed in a two-choice DMTS format. As noted in the Method section of               Experiment 1, the instructions for the DMTS transfer test were minimal. Thus, the               instant generalization of class indicative performances to DMTS trials attests to the               format independence of the baseline and derived relations that emerged in the trace               SP2R format.

Explanatory power of equivalence class accounts of complex behavior 
As noted in the Introduction, equivalence class formation has been posited as a               behavioral account of complex forms of human relational responding ( ;  ). To be used as a               broad-based account, it is necessary to show that equivalence classes can be formed               with reliability in a number of different training and testing formats. The results of               Experiments 2 and 3 showed that equivalence classes can be formed reliably using               trials presented in an SP2R format. Thus, equivalence classes can be formed with high               likelihood in at least two formats: MTS and SP2R. The results of these experiments,               then, bolster the explanatory power of equivalence-based accounts of complex human               behavior.

Summary 
Three experiments identified variables that influenced the formation of equivalence               classes where training and testing were conducted using trials presented in a trace               SP2R format. With minimal prior training, about 50% of participants formed               classes, regardless of the labels used to identify the response options. In contrast,               close to 100% of participants formed equivalence classes after preliminary               training with one of two forms of a PTI protocol. The efficacy of both protocols did               not depend on the inclusion of transitive relations trials but was dependent on the               ordering of stimulus sets in the protocol. Regardless of prior training, performances               were highly similar among participants who formed classes, and likewise for those who               did not, Performances among subjects who did and did not form classes, however, were               highly dissimilar. The successful completion of the PTI protocols, then, probably               established or strengthened stimulus control repertoires that (a) enabled the rapid               acquisition of new conditional discriminations, (b) enhanced resistance to disruption               of baseline relations during feedback reduction, (c) promoted the immediate emergence               of symmetrical relations, and (d) increased the emergence of transitive relations               mediated by within-class baseline relations. These stimulus control topographies were               probably components of the current repertoires of the participants who formed               equivalence classes without prior training. The results of these experiments               strengthened explanatory accounts of the emergence of complex forms of human behavior               in terms of equivalence class formation.

prevalence cases without identified epidemiologic link raises concerns unrecognized transmission suggests contact tracing efforts alone might sufficient stop disease transmission contact tracing yields laboratory confirmation infection among contacts higher South Korea Shenzhen Guangzhou China Consistent findings recent studies found household contacts infected higher rate nonhousehold

Utah contacts could opt receive daily phone calls text message notifications Text messaging might improve efficiency decreasing time contact followup requires additional resources robust information technology infrastructure strong data protection safeguards Smartphone technology another powerful tool contact tracing widely accepted smartphone application major privacy concerns including

identifying index cases contacts implement isolation protocols J Joung et al unpub data httpsdoiorg could improve contact tracing metrics Online platforms identify cases contacts linked MicrobeTrace httpsmicrobetracecdcgovMicrobeTrace also could aid management investigations reducing duplicative efforts thereby improving efficiency ongoing COVID pandemic emergence SARSCoV B Delta variant demonstrated need continuing layered prevention strategies including contact tracing findings help local state jurisdictions determine cost effort yields associated implementing comprehensive contact

costs contact tracing underestimated could account overtime benefits timeandahalf pay overhead staff health insurance facility utility costs staff training time time spent providing services community time drop masks expenditures Sixth could track many persons complied recommendations selfisolate quarantine ability determine whether cases contacts complied recommendations would aid quantifying contact tracing yield effort Finally patients seek care potentially presymptomatic asymptomatic infection challenge preventing additional cases SARSCoV shedding highest early illness found asymptomatic contacts tested SARSCoVpositive asymptomatic contacts tested Therefore attack rate might underestimated given large proportion asymptomatic contacts get tested conclusion analysis highlights importance contact tracing reduce transmission SARSCoV However effectiveness contact tracing contingent upon availability substantial resources rapid testing capacity Persons seek testing

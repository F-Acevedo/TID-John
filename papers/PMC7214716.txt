growing concerns surrounding recognized unrecognized implications smartphone use great efforts made research evaluate label identify problematic smartphone use mostly development administration scales assessing behavior study examines existing validated scales developed past years measure identify characterize excessive problematic smartphone use evaluating theoretical foundations psychometric properties review determined despite abundance selfreport scales examining construct many published scales lack sufficient internal consistency testretest reliability Additionally lack research supporting theoretical foundation many scales evaluated Future research needed better characterize problematic smartphone use assessment tools efficiently developed evaluate behavior order avoid excessive publication seemingly redundant assessment tools Keywords mobile phone smartphone problematic use addiction assessment Introduction Smartphone ownership become increasingly prevalent past decade since Apples first iPhone smartphone device launched Apple Inc Consumer Technology Association CTA revealed smartphones owned United States homes predicted smartphone ownership could reach household TV ownership rates within years Twice Staff However fields psychology cognition mere ownership technological devices causing increased concern instead potential dysfunction associated smartphone use leading researchers stress importance investigating behavior Therefore purpose paper fold First review literature examining psychological behavioral dysfunctions related smartphone use well probe potential role problematic smartphone usage may occupy within realm addiction research Second present exhaustive review assessment scales measure problematic smartphone mobile phone use including overview reliability ie internal consistency testretest reliability criterionrelated validity scale Third provide specific recommendations moving field forward including furthering research order standardize conceptualization behavior Associated Dysfunction important note standard cutoff point determine smartphone use becomes problematic yet established Due insufficient research investigating problematic smartphone use order effectively consistently characterize currently unclear whether problematic use ought defined use quantity patterns use negative consequences use Billieux conducted frequently cited literature review dysfunctional mobile phone use defined problematic use mobile phones inability regulate ones use mobile phone eventually involves negative consequences daily life pg Numerous research studies indicating smartphone use related various facets dysfunction support Billieuxs conceptualization problematic use contingent upon negative consequences associated use Evidence accumulated showing strong links smartphone use social interpersonal mental health cognition academic dysfunction suggesting smartphone use result significant negative consequences individuals see review Billieux example although smartphones provide unique opportunities social interaction Scott et al found problematic attachment technology smartphone devices associated lowered social skills emotional intelligence empathy well increased conflict others Additionally Laramie identified social anxiety loneliness associated heavy use reliance upon mobile phones suggesting smartphone overuse may result interpersonal dysfunction Relatedly selfreported subjective smartphone addiction shown negatively correlated psychological wellbeing Kumcagiz Gndz Several studies revealed evidence low selfesteem Bianchi Phillips Hong et al depression anxiety DeSola et al b Elhai et al Matar Boumosleh Jaalouk associated problematic smartphone use especially populations adolescents young adults results studies present rationale justified concern surrounding potential negative psychological consequences smartphone overuse Similarly concern grown potential negative impacts smartphone use might users behavior cognitive abilities Research shown problematic smartphone use related impulsivity Contractor et al DeSola et al b Hadar et al impaired attention Roberts et al Hadar et al compromised inhibitory control Chen et al associated cognitive deficits spurred researchers investigate potential dysfunction academic performance well Smartphone use shown negatively correlate academic progress success Alosaimi et al Hawi Samaha Samaha Hawi Findings studies suggest cognitive dysfunction associated smartphone overuse may result realworld consequences individuals reiterate despite research efforts characterizing associated dysfunction standardized conceptualization problematic smartphone use yet established field However previously described areas dysfunction eg social interpersonal mental health cognition academia found associated smartphone use support Billieuxs conceptualization problematic smartphone use contingent upon negative consequences associated use many assessment tools problematic use tap types negative life consequences likely identify individuals excessive smartphone use especially harmful Smartphone Addiction Real Concept American Psychiatric Association APA broadly defines addiction complex condition brain disease manifested compulsive substance use despite harmful consequences pg American Psychiatric Association definition use substances requirement condition addicted one must substance addicted behavioral addictions Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders DSM American Psychiatric Association International Classification Diseases ICD World Health Organization grouped behavioral addictions within respective substance dependence categories Recategorization addictions seen DSM resulting gambling disorder recognized nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder American Psychiatric Association Additionally Internet Gaming Disorder IGD included DSM condition study American Psychiatric Association Finally gambling disorder gaming disorder grouped together ICD World Health Organization suggesting behavioral addictions share common ground substance use disorders SUD Despite conceptual similarity Billieux et al argue addictive behaviors like problematic smartphone use associated several types associated dysfunction research arena inconsistent documenting significant behavioral neurobiological similarities correlates widely recognized substance addictions example many features substance addiction appear present considering excessive smartphone use little research documented presence loss control ie trouble consciously limiting ones smartphone use tolerance ie increasing smartphone use achieve satisfaction withdrawal ie negative symptoms occur smartphone use discontinuation Billieux et al Also dependence symptoms tolerance withdrawal theoretically based physiological adaptation increasing amounts drug often absent behavioral addictions review IGD Kaptsis et al find consistent answers questions inquiring withdrawal symptoms effects mood ie feeling irritable dissatisfied moody unable play game IGD Similarly physiological neurobiological adaptations increasing amounts smartphone use yet documented suggesting researchers may need use criterion define problematic smartphone use researchers argued borrowing criteria recognized addictive behaviors like substance abuse problematic gambling might fit certain problematic excessive behaviors Starcevic Thus although sharing common ground problematic smartphone use may substantially differ substance addiction regards loss control tolerance withdrawal criteria addiction map better Aforementioned associated life dysfunction becoming increasingly documented meaning problematic use smartphone devices realworld negative consequences individuals Compulsive use documented Parasuraman et al found participants would quit using smartphones even though daily lifestyles negatively affected excessive use irresistible impulse use ones smartphone despite wanting stop reminiscent individuals SUDs drive use drugs overrides executive control processes Six symptom criteria even proposed diagnose smartphone addiction related functional impairment based guidelines SUDs IGD Lin et al dropped tolerance final criterion due low diagnostic accuracy However included withdrawal subjects used smartphones excessively enough considered addicted displayed feelings dysphoria anxiety andor irritability period without smartphones Dependency appears extent excess smartphone users although based subjective selfreport study conducted Parasuraman et al analyzing smartphone use behavior almost smartphone users reported feeling dependent upon smartphone devices users felt though unable withstand smartphone Additionally participants indicated use smartphone longer intended Similarly results research study released Sun newspaper March indicated one ten college students say addicted smartphones Hope Upon surveying college students students endorsed question constantly checking smartphones figure time students responded sleep smartphones lying beside data indicate used excessively smartphones become problematic users report feeling though addiction Laws even enacted many states combat problematic use Phone use driving vehicle become major concern shown anticipation incoming calls messages notifications directly correlates greater invehicle phone use OConnor et al Additionally recently city Honolulu Hawaii even gone far enact law making illegal pedestrians use phones crossing street highway Honolulu Hawaii Ordinance Bill due significant increase pedestrian fatalities city partially attributed smartphone distraction Ellis Thus individuals using smartphones risky physically hazardous situations conceptually similar recognized addiction criteria SUDs DSM DSM Criteria Considerations reviewed problematic smartphone use shares conceptual similarities typically recognized addictions including excessive use failure impulse control feelings dependency use risky andor physically hazardous situations potential negative affect using ones smartphone term addiction typically characterized criterion question whether behavioral addictions must contain criterion considered true addiction still debate Starcevic suggested behavioral addictions characterized salient behaviors promote craving neglect life activity loss control tolerance withdrawal manifestations negative consequences overuse Gambling disorder considered impulse control disorder DSMIV American Psychiatric Association characterized grouped SUDs recent DSM American Psychiatric Association new category psychopathology entitled SubstanceRelated Addictive Disorders transition result wide body research demonstrating clinical phenomenological genetic neurobiological similarities gambling disorder SUDs Potenza gambling disorder currently representative member NonSubstanceRelated Disorders subsection transition important shift recognition behavioral addictions broadly Many researchers advocate similar recognition problematic smartphone use eg Potenza et al Support recognition problematic smartphone use also motivated growing body research literature Internet addiction seen since late Kimberly Young considered founder concept Internet addiction due publication case study

interchangeably across studies often within studies smartphones significantly components capabilities mobile phones problematic use two different forms technology viewed differently comparisons published scales made light distinctive differences two types technology scales arranged based upon date published within three tables starting first developed scale recently published scales Thus likely recently developed scales involved specific analyses smartphone use behavior opposed contemporary mobile phone devices Scales included Table specifically developed validated identify

deciding scale utilized research practice term addiction used frequently naming many problematic smartphone use scales due choice framework criterionrelated validity used developing validating scales Many scale developers used either DSMIV DSM criteria substance use examine criterionrelated validity development Others chose use Griffiths components descriptive model addiction includes following core components salience mood modification tolerance withdrawal conflict relapse Similarly Internet addiction frequently used establish criterionrelated validity release first smartphone problematic Internet use observed identified subsequently labeled Internet addiction Addiction scales quickly developed assist identifying behavior Youngs Internet Addiction Test IAT YScale Young smartphones developed made available public problematic smartphone use similarly became concern Many researchers utilized various Internet addiction scales validate scales eg SMSPUDQ ECPUS MPAI SAPS One final ways scale developers established criterionrelated validity utilizing quantified smartphone use criterion determine whether scales could used identify smartphone addiction However scale development processes involved selfreported selfestimated smartphone use unable utilize concrete exact documentation participants smartphone use time relied upon estimation unreliable Andrews et al therefore considered practical accurate means validating scale Even accurate data obtained participants concerning time spent using phones established cutoff point used validate accuracy scale indicating dependency problematic use addiction based upon extensiveness use alone since determined point phone use becomes problematic likely cutoff point quantitative smartphone use may feasible Elhai et al explains smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use describe high frequency smartphone use functional eg productive smartphone use purposes work school dysfunctional others eg excessive gaming social media use Additionally significant number scales described Tables relied upon existing measurement scales problematic phone use order establish concurrent validity scale developing due recognized issue currently gold standard criterionrelated validity problematic phone use addiction However concerning considering existing assessments used validate new scale likely also used problematic criteria establish criterionrelated validity example developing Smartphone Impact Scale SIS Pancani et al included widely used Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b

scales well developed assess smartphone use frequency motivations attitudes conducting systematic search identifying relevant measures analyzed psychometric properties criterionrelated validity scale However despite identifying validated scales able fully determine efficient scales measuring problematic phone usage due several issues scales established criterion validity using DSMIV DSM criteria gambling disorder substanceuse disorders even though still considerable controversy whether problematic smartphone use considered addiction testretest reliability coefficients reported development articles scales internal consistency testretest reliability available seven scales causes concern future analyses attempt identify efficient scales goldstandard criteria cutoff scores problematic

research Scale Content addition gambling disorder substancerelated addictive disorders section DSM nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder subsequently opened door behaviors researched evaluated identified developed validated scales Another example would behavioral condition known internet gaming disorder IGD area research warrants study according DSM American Psychiatric Association proposed criteria IGD behavioral addiction involving problematic use video game technology closely resembles criteria SUD similar researchers conceptualizing problematic smartphone use Lin et al based development methods majority reviewed scales many researchers feel though could time start assessing smartphone use addictive framework mind arguably exception tolerance symptoms Lin et al may part due belief problematic smartphone use well potentially problematic behaviors similarly characterized defined diagnosable behavioral nonsubstancerelated addictions majority reviewed scales reflect viewpoint content domain scales see Table related dependencerelated concepts including craving tolerance withdrawal excessive time spent using negative life consequences scales moved away content domain development attempted measure specific different aspects problematic smartphone use example Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire Walsh et al Media Technology Usage Attitudes Scale Rosen et al examine smartphone use involvement items assessing euphoria salience overall usage perhaps reflects rationale smartphones may especially cognitively behaviorally salient resulting usage without usage necessarily pathological uncontrollable addictive nature scales perhaps measure construct liking pleasurable impact habitual smartphone use compared scales measuring construct wanting compulsive motivation engage smartphone use resulting negative life consequences reflects important distinction considering behavioral addiction framework todays society smartphones linked several forms reward social value makes sense people would like smartphones feel important use many times day necessarily reflect addiction despite individuals tendency selfreport reviewed scales perhaps better conceptualized measuring maladaptive smartphone use rather addictive use endorsements behaviors perhaps rise severity levels addiction Panova Carbonell similar vein scales appear measure degree

communication resulting strong preferences ones smartphone device instantly accessible emotional attachment resulting dysphoria mimic addiction withdrawal symptoms way Problematic smartphone use often cooccurs depression anxiety means experiential avoidance Elhai et al scales criteria may simply reflecting strong liking ease communication others via callingtexting result different emotional reactions depending whether device accessible Future research examine endorsement particular problematic smartphone use behaviors perhaps better explained general psychopathology like depression anxiety rather addiction Numerous researchers published scales purportedly assessing smartphone addiction phone addiction However researchers feel though currently necessary evidence supported research accurately conceptualize smartphone use capability developing addictive behavior Griffiths argues yet position confirm existence serious persistent psychopathological addictive disorder related mobile phone addiction basis population survey data alone p Perhaps reason standard cutoff point determine smartphone use becomes problematic yet established Similarly Internet addiction framework frequently used developers several reviewed problematic smartphone use scales establish criterionrelated validity However Internet addiction currently recognized DSM nonsubstance related addictive disorder due lack research indicating similarity manifestation dysfunction addictive disorders recognized DSM Additionally lack sufficient research investigating effectively characterize problematic smartphone use currently unclear whether problematic ought defined quantity use patterns use negative consequences marked distress result usage researchers intend define problematic smartphone use addiction similar substanceuse disorder three criteria among others eg recurrent use situations physically hazardous continued use despite persistent recurrent social interpersonal problems caused exacerbated use would need present order diagnose dysfunctional problematic smartphone use addiction American Psychiatric Association reflected selfreport scales researchers developing testing validating Panova Carbonell support Griffiths previously described argument similarly suggest moving away addiction framework considering problematic behaviors problematic use smartphone technological devices reference pattern weak study designs smartphone literature full reliance correlational studies lack longitudinal experimental studies examine associated cognitive psychological behavior dysfunction also strongly advocate use terms problematic use addiction describing behaviors noted imperative researchsupported criterion problematic smartphone use identified using officially

assessed phone use selfreport therefore reliably measure actual phone usage limitation particular field research needs addressed developing new scales many researchers hypotheses creating scales problematic phone use would correlate actual use instead associated personality traits including selfesteem impulsivity eg Bianchi Phillips Billieux et al Leung Future research may aim develop modify existing scale consider running experimental study actively measure phone usage among individuals includes method separate normal problematic use Interestingly global researchers Monge Roffarello De Russis well Google recently created smartphone applications eg Socialize Digital Wellbeing track phone usage among features even provide intervention excessive use eg allowing users set limits amount time allotted specific application usage per week per day applications excellent examples researchers consider using alternative selfreport scales measuring smartphone usage research setting applications would provide investigators opportunity gather objective data smartphone use smartphoneusing participants following instruction application downloaded participants phones specific period time Future research ought also investigate effectiveness applications intervention tools problematic smartphone use However reiterate due heterogeneity smartphone use frequency ie functional versus dysfunctional described Elhai et al researchers recognize objective smartphone use data collected use applications methods measure smartphone use frequency necessarily problematic smartphone use Additionally necessary steps ought taken safeguard ethical considerations minimize risks associated instructing participants download applications smartphone devices inherent function tracking activity eg protection privacy Secondly majority development articles reviewed scales reported internal consistency means establishing reliability scale Internal consistency widely used scale development coefficient based interrelatedness items within scale However mean items whole necessarily related intended construct possess established validity going rank scales reliable based solely internal consistency coefficients PMUM MTUAS SAS would top list However researchers Thompson called use internal consistency sole measure reliability sloppy representative quality scale higher Cronbachs alpha may demonstrate consistency items measure items may accurately capturing problematic phone usage reliability validity statistics offered development articles reviewed scales perhaps

Limitations Current Study review without limitations First databases used systematic search PsycINFO EBSOhost MEDLINE Complete EBSCOhost PsycINFO utilized due specialized database provide unique search results specific topics psychology additionally used several largely cited systematic reviews Bramer et al Elhai et al also utilized MEDLINE Complete database rather PubMed interface due

contrast numerous scales published past years analyze psychometric properties individual scales order determine included scales considered adequate tools assessing problematic smartphone use smartphone addiction However recommended research conducted sufficiently conceptualize behavior development manifestation associated dysfunction order best develop tools assess behavior must first

evaluating theoretical foundations psychometric properties review determined despite abundance selfreport scales examining construct many published scales lack sufficient internal consistency testretest reliability Additionally lack research supporting theoretical foundation many scales evaluated Future research needed better characterize problematic smartphone use assessment tools efficiently developed evaluate behavior order avoid excessive publication seemingly redundant assessment tools Keywords mobile phone smartphone problematic use addiction assessment Introduction Smartphone ownership become increasingly prevalent past decade since Apples first iPhone smartphone device launched Apple Inc Consumer Technology Association CTA revealed smartphones owned United States homes predicted smartphone ownership could reach household TV ownership rates within years Twice Staff However fields psychology cognition mere ownership technological devices causing increased concern instead potential dysfunction associated smartphone use leading researchers stress importance investigating behavior Therefore purpose paper fold First review literature examining psychological behavioral dysfunctions related smartphone use well probe potential role problematic smartphone usage may occupy within realm addiction research Second present exhaustive review assessment scales measure problematic smartphone mobile phone use including overview reliability ie internal consistency testretest reliability criterionrelated validity scale Third provide specific recommendations moving field forward including furthering research order standardize conceptualization behavior Associated Dysfunction important note standard cutoff point determine smartphone use becomes problematic yet established Due insufficient research investigating problematic smartphone use order effectively consistently characterize currently unclear whether problematic use ought defined use quantity patterns use negative consequences use Billieux conducted frequently cited literature review dysfunctional mobile phone use defined problematic use mobile phones inability regulate ones use mobile phone eventually involves negative consequences daily life pg Numerous research studies indicating smartphone use related various facets dysfunction support Billieuxs conceptualization problematic use contingent upon negative consequences associated use Evidence accumulated showing strong links smartphone use social interpersonal mental health cognition academic dysfunction suggesting smartphone use result significant negative consequences individuals see review Billieux example although smartphones provide unique opportunities social interaction Scott et al found problematic attachment technology smartphone devices associated lowered social skills emotional intelligence empathy well increased conflict others Additionally Laramie identified social anxiety loneliness associated heavy use reliance upon mobile phones suggesting smartphone overuse may result interpersonal dysfunction Relatedly selfreported subjective smartphone addiction shown negatively correlated psychological wellbeing Kumcagiz Gndz Several studies revealed evidence low selfesteem Bianchi Phillips Hong et al depression anxiety DeSola et al b Elhai et al Matar Boumosleh Jaalouk associated problematic smartphone use especially populations adolescents young adults results studies present rationale justified concern surrounding potential negative psychological consequences smartphone overuse Similarly concern grown potential negative impacts smartphone use might users behavior cognitive abilities Research shown problematic smartphone use related impulsivity Contractor et al DeSola et al b Hadar et al impaired attention Roberts et al Hadar et al compromised inhibitory control Chen et al associated cognitive deficits spurred researchers investigate potential dysfunction academic performance well Smartphone use shown negatively correlate academic progress success Alosaimi et al Hawi Samaha Samaha Hawi Findings studies suggest cognitive dysfunction associated smartphone overuse may result realworld consequences individuals reiterate despite research efforts characterizing associated dysfunction standardized conceptualization problematic smartphone use yet established field However previously described areas dysfunction eg social interpersonal mental health cognition academia found associated smartphone use support Billieuxs conceptualization problematic smartphone use contingent upon negative consequences associated use many assessment tools problematic use tap types negative life consequences likely identify individuals excessive smartphone use especially harmful Smartphone Addiction Real Concept American Psychiatric Association APA broadly defines addiction complex condition brain disease manifested compulsive substance use despite harmful consequences pg American Psychiatric Association definition use substances requirement condition addicted one must substance addicted behavioral addictions Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders DSM American Psychiatric Association International Classification Diseases ICD World Health Organization grouped behavioral addictions within respective substance dependence categories Recategorization addictions seen DSM resulting gambling disorder recognized nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder American Psychiatric Association Additionally Internet Gaming Disorder IGD included DSM condition study American Psychiatric Association Finally gambling disorder gaming disorder grouped together ICD World Health Organization suggesting behavioral addictions share common ground substance use disorders SUD Despite conceptual similarity Billieux et al argue addictive behaviors like problematic smartphone use associated several types associated dysfunction research arena inconsistent documenting significant behavioral neurobiological similarities correlates widely recognized substance addictions example many features substance addiction appear present considering excessive smartphone use little research documented presence loss control ie trouble consciously limiting ones smartphone use tolerance ie increasing smartphone use achieve satisfaction withdrawal ie negative symptoms occur smartphone use discontinuation Billieux et al Also dependence symptoms tolerance withdrawal theoretically based physiological adaptation increasing amounts drug often absent behavioral addictions review IGD Kaptsis et al find consistent answers questions inquiring withdrawal symptoms effects mood ie feeling irritable dissatisfied moody unable play game IGD Similarly physiological neurobiological adaptations increasing amounts smartphone use yet documented suggesting researchers may need use criterion define problematic smartphone use researchers argued borrowing criteria recognized addictive behaviors like substance abuse problematic gambling might fit certain problematic excessive behaviors Starcevic Thus although sharing common ground problematic smartphone use may substantially differ substance addiction regards loss control tolerance withdrawal criteria addiction map better Aforementioned associated life dysfunction becoming increasingly documented meaning problematic use smartphone devices realworld negative consequences individuals Compulsive use documented Parasuraman et al found participants would quit using smartphones even though daily lifestyles negatively affected excessive use irresistible impulse use ones smartphone despite wanting stop reminiscent individuals SUDs drive use drugs overrides executive control processes Six symptom criteria even proposed diagnose smartphone addiction related functional impairment based guidelines SUDs IGD Lin et al dropped tolerance final criterion due low diagnostic accuracy However included withdrawal subjects used smartphones excessively enough considered addicted displayed feelings dysphoria anxiety andor irritability period without smartphones Dependency appears extent excess smartphone users although based subjective selfreport study conducted Parasuraman et al analyzing smartphone use behavior almost smartphone users reported feeling dependent upon smartphone devices users felt though unable withstand smartphone Additionally participants indicated use smartphone longer intended Similarly results research study released Sun newspaper March indicated one ten college students say addicted smartphones Hope Upon surveying college students students endorsed question constantly checking smartphones figure time students responded sleep smartphones lying beside data indicate used excessively smartphones become problematic users report feeling though addiction Laws even enacted many states combat problematic use Phone use driving vehicle become major concern shown anticipation incoming calls messages notifications directly correlates greater invehicle phone use OConnor et al Additionally recently city Honolulu Hawaii even gone far enact law making illegal pedestrians use phones crossing street highway Honolulu Hawaii Ordinance Bill due significant increase pedestrian fatalities city partially attributed smartphone distraction Ellis Thus individuals using smartphones risky physically hazardous situations conceptually similar recognized addiction criteria SUDs DSM DSM Criteria Considerations reviewed problematic smartphone use shares conceptual similarities typically recognized addictions including excessive use failure impulse control feelings dependency use risky andor physically hazardous situations potential negative affect using ones smartphone term addiction typically characterized criterion question whether behavioral addictions must contain criterion considered true addiction still debate Starcevic suggested behavioral addictions characterized salient behaviors promote craving neglect life activity loss control tolerance withdrawal manifestations negative consequences overuse Gambling

SubstanceRelated Addictive Disorders transition result wide body research demonstrating clinical phenomenological genetic neurobiological similarities gambling disorder SUDs Potenza gambling disorder

Description Measurement Scales Following development first mobile phone use measurement scales Toda et al mobile phone ownership began decreasing smartphones became increasingly popular However transition mobile phone use smartphone era terms mobile phone smartphone used interchangeably across studies often within studies smartphones significantly components capabilities mobile phones problematic use two different forms technology viewed differently comparisons published scales made light distinctive differences two types technology scales arranged based upon date published within three tables starting first developed scale recently published scales Thus likely recently developed scales involved specific analyses smartphone use behavior opposed contemporary mobile phone devices Scales included Table specifically developed validated identify problematic smartphone mobile phone use diagnose individuals smartphone addiction overuse dependency attachment etc eg Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b Smartphone Addiction Inventory SPAI Lin et al Although construct claimed measured individual scales may differ many similar theoretical foundations even item content example Kwon et al b utilized DSMIV criteria substance dependence develop item content SAS goal assessing addiction Merlo et al utilized criteria develop Problematic Use Mobile Phones PUMP scale Table validated shortened versions originally validated scales included review identified literature review Table includes majority scales identified review Table hand contains three scales table includes scales assessing smartphone use frequency opposed general problematic smartphone use behavior important note differences two constructs described earlier smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use Elhai et al Higher frequency smartphone use may indicate presence problematic smartphone use example associated life dysfunction identified Billieux Scales included table include Media Technology Usage Attitudes Scale MTUAS Rosen et al assesses use technological devices including smartphones attitudes surrounding technology use see Table Smartphone Use Frequency SUF Elhai et al assessing use smartphone devices areas calling messaging emailing etc Mobile Usage Scale MUS Konok et al examining differences use smartphones traditional mobile phones scales included review provide researchers options examining problematic smartphone use andor smartphone use frequency Finally additional scales assessing motivations well attitudes surrounding use smartphone devices included Table example MTUAS Rosen et al included Tables although assesses frequency smartphone technology usage also examines attitudes associated usage Additionally Process vs Social Smartphone Usage Scale PSSU van Deursen et al included Table due examination motivations use smartphone devices Finally third example scale included Table Mobile Phone Affinity Scale MPAS Bock et al evaluates motivations smartphone use including connectedness productivity empowerment etc important include six scales Table inclusion exemplifies robust nature research development measurement scales focusing smartphone use inclusion three domains makes review useful tool researchers studying smartphone use behavior problematic otherwise well associated benefits dysfunction Psychometric Characteristics Elements criterionrelated validity content domains internal consistency temporal stability purported construct listed briefly described scales Tables tables used compare individual scales Additionally following analysis psychometric properties conceptual foundations scales included review dissected analysis help researchers practitioners alike consider psychometric properties theoretical foundations potential assessment tools deciding scale utilized research practice term addiction used frequently naming many problematic smartphone use scales due choice framework criterionrelated validity used developing validating scales Many scale developers used either DSMIV DSM criteria substance use examine criterionrelated validity development Others chose use Griffiths components descriptive model addiction includes following core components salience mood modification tolerance withdrawal conflict relapse Similarly Internet addiction frequently used establish criterionrelated validity release first smartphone problematic Internet use observed identified subsequently labeled Internet addiction Addiction scales quickly developed assist identifying behavior Youngs Internet Addiction Test IAT YScale Young smartphones developed made available public problematic smartphone use similarly became concern Many researchers utilized various Internet addiction scales validate scales eg SMSPUDQ ECPUS MPAI SAPS One final ways scale developers established criterionrelated validity utilizing quantified smartphone use criterion determine whether scales could used identify smartphone addiction However scale development processes involved selfreported selfestimated smartphone use unable utilize concrete exact documentation participants smartphone use time relied upon estimation unreliable Andrews et al therefore considered practical accurate means validating scale Even accurate data obtained participants concerning time spent using phones established cutoff point used validate accuracy scale indicating dependency problematic use addiction based upon extensiveness use alone since determined point phone use becomes problematic likely cutoff point quantitative smartphone use may feasible Elhai et al explains smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use describe high frequency smartphone use functional eg productive smartphone use purposes work school dysfunctional others eg excessive gaming social media use Additionally significant number scales described Tables relied upon existing measurement scales problematic phone use order establish concurrent validity scale developing due recognized issue currently gold standard criterionrelated validity problematic phone use addiction However concerning considering existing assessments used validate new scale likely also used problematic criteria establish criterionrelated validity example developing Smartphone Impact Scale SIS Pancani et al included widely used Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b study validate SIS Italian adult sample could problematic two reasons Firstly knowledge SAS yet validated use Italian adults developed using population Korean adults Secondly knowledge temporal stability SAS yet investigated Selection content domains researchers validation studies stemmed conceptual foundation scales development criterionrelated validity example regarding scales Table DSMIV pathological gambling criteria DSM gambling disorder criteria used establish criterionrelated validity seven scales COS MPAI CERM KBUTK MAT AMPUH ATeMo Therefore scales content domains shown reflect diagnostic criteria associated problematic gambling disorder DSM indicates diagnosed gambling disorder individual must exhibit four following symptoms tolerance withdrawal lack control preoccupation escape problems chasing losses deception associated life dysfunction areas relationships job education finances American Psychiatric Association Excluding chasing losses factors shown consistently reflected across seven scales terms established content domains DSMIV DSMIVTR DSM criteria SUDs frequently used validate problematic smartphone use scales diagnostic criteria similarly reflected content domains established validation studies eg CERM PCPUQ SAS Internal consistency degree interrelatedness among scale items Mokkink et al measure reliability reported scales form Cronbachs value However despite importance scale development internal consistency value reported seven scales validation studies STDS DENA MPIQ MAT MPUQ MIUI SAMI Cronbachs values reported ranged MPUS PMUM MTUAS SAS Although inconsistency field regarding point Cronbachs values considered adequate acceptable acceptable values alpha reported range Nunnally Bernstein Bland Altman DeVellis Using lowest value reported acceptable adequate cutoff four scales identified review PMPUQ IMAT MPUS MTUAS would meet standard Although internal consistency important scale development scale developers failed account temporal stability guaranteeing reliability Upon analyzing psychometric properties various scales discovered scale development ten scales testretest reliability coefficients provided indicate scales temporal stability cause concern even frequently used scales failed ensure temporal stability development eg SAS NMPQ SABAS Discussion review first identify report method development problematic smartphone use scales well developed assess smartphone use frequency motivations attitudes conducting systematic search identifying relevant measures analyzed psychometric properties criterionrelated validity scale However despite identifying validated scales able fully determine efficient scales measuring problematic phone usage due several issues scales established criterion validity using DSMIV DSM criteria gambling disorder substanceuse disorders even though still considerable controversy whether problematic smartphone use considered addiction testretest reliability coefficients reported development articles scales internal consistency testretest reliability available seven scales causes concern future analyses attempt identify efficient scales goldstandard criteria cutoff scores problematic smartphone use yet established words scales accurately compared contrasted since validated goldstandard criteria strive incorporate Therefore primarily discuss practical ideas recommendations future research Scale Content addition gambling disorder substancerelated addictive disorders section DSM nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder subsequently opened door behaviors researched evaluated identified developed validated scales Another example would behavioral condition known internet gaming disorder IGD area research warrants study according DSM American Psychiatric Association proposed criteria IGD behavioral addiction involving problematic use video game technology closely resembles criteria SUD similar researchers conceptualizing problematic smartphone use Lin et al based development methods majority reviewed scales many researchers feel though could time start assessing smartphone use addictive framework mind arguably exception tolerance symptoms Lin et al may part due belief problematic smartphone use well potentially problematic behaviors similarly characterized defined diagnosable behavioral nonsubstancerelated addictions majority reviewed scales reflect viewpoint content domain scales see Table related dependencerelated concepts including craving tolerance withdrawal excessive time spent using negative life consequences scales moved away content domain development attempted measure specific different aspects problematic smartphone use example Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire Walsh et al Media Technology Usage Attitudes Scale Rosen et al examine smartphone use involvement items assessing euphoria salience overall usage perhaps reflects rationale smartphones may especially cognitively behaviorally salient resulting usage without usage necessarily pathological uncontrollable addictive nature scales perhaps measure construct liking pleasurable impact habitual smartphone use compared scales measuring construct wanting compulsive motivation engage smartphone use resulting negative life consequences reflects important distinction considering behavioral addiction framework todays society smartphones linked several forms reward social value makes sense people would like smartphones feel important use many times day necessarily reflect addiction despite individuals tendency selfreport reviewed scales perhaps better conceptualized measuring maladaptive smartphone use rather addictive use endorsements behaviors perhaps rise severity levels addiction Panova Carbonell similar vein scales appear measure degree individuals report salient emotional connections smartphone Young Adult Attachment Phone Scale Trub Barbot Adolescent Preoccupations Screens Scale Hunter et al share item content related feelings safety feelings anxiety without ones phone scales measure attachment styles individuals mood state shift depending smartphone devices proximity relative convenience smartphone functions daily life mean feelings irritation concern likely present one immediate access Relatedly scales like Mobile Attachment Scale Konok et al Mobile Phone Affinity Scale Bock et al items measure preference mobile communication resulting strong preferences ones smartphone device instantly accessible emotional attachment resulting dysphoria mimic addiction withdrawal symptoms way Problematic smartphone use often cooccurs depression anxiety means experiential avoidance Elhai et al scales criteria may simply reflecting strong liking ease communication others via callingtexting result different emotional reactions depending whether device accessible Future research examine endorsement particular problematic smartphone use behaviors perhaps better explained general psychopathology like depression anxiety rather addiction Numerous researchers published scales purportedly assessing smartphone addiction phone addiction However researchers feel though currently necessary evidence supported research accurately conceptualize smartphone use capability developing addictive behavior Griffiths argues yet position confirm existence serious persistent psychopathological addictive disorder related mobile phone addiction basis population survey data alone p Perhaps reason standard cutoff point determine smartphone use becomes problematic yet established Similarly Internet addiction framework frequently used developers several reviewed problematic smartphone use scales establish criterionrelated validity However Internet addiction currently recognized DSM nonsubstance related addictive disorder due lack research indicating similarity manifestation dysfunction addictive disorders recognized DSM Additionally lack sufficient research investigating effectively characterize problematic smartphone use currently unclear whether problematic ought defined quantity use patterns use negative consequences marked distress result usage researchers intend define problematic smartphone use addiction similar substanceuse disorder three criteria among others eg recurrent use situations physically hazardous continued use despite persistent recurrent social interpersonal problems caused exacerbated use would need present order diagnose dysfunctional problematic smartphone use addiction American Psychiatric Association reflected selfreport scales researchers developing testing validating Panova Carbonell support Griffiths previously described argument similarly suggest moving away addiction framework considering problematic behaviors problematic use smartphone technological devices reference pattern weak study designs smartphone literature full reliance correlational studies lack longitudinal experimental studies examine associated cognitive psychological behavior dysfunction also strongly advocate use terms problematic use addiction describing behaviors noted imperative researchsupported criterion problematic smartphone use identified using officially recognized addictive disorders establish criterionrelated validity Limitations Reviewed Scales addition many fundamental limitations development intended uses reviewed scales instance reviewed scales assessed phone use selfreport therefore reliably measure actual phone usage limitation particular field research needs addressed developing new scales many researchers hypotheses creating scales problematic phone use would correlate actual use instead associated personality traits including selfesteem impulsivity eg Bianchi Phillips Billieux et al Leung Future research may aim develop modify existing scale consider running experimental study actively measure phone usage among individuals includes method separate normal problematic use Interestingly global researchers Monge Roffarello De Russis well Google recently created smartphone applications eg Socialize Digital Wellbeing track phone usage among features even provide intervention excessive use eg allowing users set limits amount time allotted specific application usage per week per day applications excellent examples researchers consider using alternative selfreport scales measuring smartphone usage research setting applications would provide investigators opportunity gather objective data smartphone use smartphoneusing participants following instruction application downloaded participants phones specific period time Future research ought also investigate effectiveness applications intervention tools problematic smartphone use However reiterate due heterogeneity smartphone use frequency ie functional versus dysfunctional described Elhai et al researchers recognize objective smartphone use data collected use applications methods measure smartphone use frequency necessarily problematic smartphone use Additionally necessary steps ought taken safeguard ethical considerations minimize risks associated instructing participants download applications smartphone devices inherent function tracking activity eg protection privacy Secondly majority development articles reviewed scales reported internal consistency means establishing reliability scale Internal consistency widely used scale development coefficient based interrelatedness items within scale However mean items whole necessarily related intended construct possess established validity going rank scales reliable based solely internal consistency coefficients PMUM MTUAS SAS would top list However researchers Thompson called use internal consistency sole measure reliability sloppy representative quality scale higher Cronbachs alpha may demonstrate consistency items measure items may accurately capturing problematic phone usage reliability validity statistics offered development articles reviewed scales perhaps specific scales could recommended confidence review future use Thirdly large amount variability types samples studied development articles makes difficult compare utility scale following interpreted limitations instead interesting findings diverse origin subjects studied scales development instance small percentage studies conducted participants United States many scales written languages besides English example many six scales developed Chinese WEUS PSUMS MPAI SASC SQAPMPU MPATS four Turkish MAS PMPUS PS PMPUS seven Korean ECPUS CPAS SAPS SAI SAS SASSV SOSQ Based research conducted Pew Research Center South Korea largest percentage smartphone owners Therefore large number scales developed within population understandable Yet also several scales developed Englishspeaking areas outside United States Australia MMPUS IMAT APSS MPIQ United Kingdom PMPUQR information viewed Tables Appendix Lastly intended use reviewed scales varied depending theoretical models criteria upon based scales intended measure problematic use addiction dependence excessive use mobile phones instance Leung one earliest developers mobile phone index used measure addiction symptoms demonstrated mobile users based construction MPAI idea adolescents started excessively using mobile phones leisure time way counteracting boredom due much time enough type activity labeled leisure boredom shown associated deviant activity negative affect Interestingly large percentage scales purportedly assessing smartphone mobile phone addiction surprising given aforementioned literature opposed labeling problematic smartphone use addiction Griffiths Panova Carbonell Additionally several scales developed hopes used future clinical purposes eg diagnosis problematic smartphone use since mention problematic smartphone use disorder addiction DSMIV DSM ICD seems though authors must become content scales confined research purposes indicates need additional research conceptualization demonstrated severity problematic smartphone use whether given consideration place next edition DSM ICD unable recommend use specific scale specific scales assess behavior due lack sufficient research construct Limitations Current Study review without limitations First databases used systematic search PsycINFO EBSOhost MEDLINE Complete EBSCOhost PsycINFO utilized due specialized database provide unique search results specific topics psychology additionally used several largely cited systematic reviews Bramer et al Elhai et al also utilized MEDLINE Complete database rather PubMed interface due convenience access EBSOhost Secondly many reliability coefficients able listed due many articles published solely foreign language therefore unable identify andor interpret coefficients articles inaccessible simply coefficients reported articles last point may also expressed limitation scales Future Directions Future research must conducted order identify potential cognitive neurological physical behavioral social dysfunction related smartphone use Currently causal relationships smartphone use dysfunction previously listed areas established conceptualizing smartphone use way assert behavior become problematic clinical nature done caution Additionally standard cutoff point smartphone use becomes dysfunctional ought investigated evidence causal relationships smartphone use dysfunction well formulated standardized conceptualization behavior researchers able construct accurate specific scales identifying problematic use Conclusion review serves opportunity compare contrast numerous scales published past years analyze psychometric properties individual scales order determine included scales considered adequate tools assessing problematic smartphone use smartphone addiction However recommended research conducted sufficiently conceptualize behavior development manifestation associated

society Despite many benefits attributed technology concern grown potential excessive smartphone use become problematic nature Due growing concerns surrounding recognized unrecognized implications smartphone use great efforts made research evaluate label identify problematic smartphone use mostly development administration scales assessing behavior study examines existing validated scales developed past years measure identify characterize excessive problematic smartphone use evaluating theoretical foundations psychometric properties review determined despite abundance selfreport scales examining construct many published scales lack sufficient internal consistency testretest reliability Additionally lack research supporting theoretical foundation many scales evaluated Future research needed better characterize problematic smartphone use assessment tools efficiently developed evaluate behavior order avoid excessive publication seemingly redundant assessment tools Keywords mobile phone smartphone problematic use addiction assessment Introduction Smartphone ownership become increasingly prevalent past decade since Apples first iPhone smartphone device launched Apple Inc Consumer Technology Association CTA revealed smartphones owned United States homes predicted smartphone ownership could reach household TV ownership rates within years Twice Staff However fields psychology cognition mere ownership technological devices causing increased concern instead potential dysfunction associated smartphone use leading researchers stress importance investigating behavior Therefore purpose paper fold First review literature examining psychological behavioral dysfunctions related smartphone use well probe potential role problematic smartphone usage may occupy within realm addiction research Second present exhaustive review assessment scales measure problematic smartphone mobile phone use including overview reliability ie internal consistency testretest reliability criterionrelated validity scale Third provide specific recommendations moving field forward including furthering research order standardize conceptualization behavior Associated Dysfunction important note standard cutoff point determine smartphone use becomes problematic yet established Due insufficient research investigating problematic smartphone use order effectively consistently characterize currently unclear whether problematic use ought defined use quantity patterns use negative consequences use Billieux conducted frequently cited literature review dysfunctional mobile phone use defined problematic use mobile phones inability regulate ones use mobile phone eventually involves negative consequences daily life pg Numerous research studies indicating smartphone use related various facets dysfunction support Billieuxs conceptualization problematic use contingent upon negative consequences associated use Evidence accumulated showing strong links smartphone use social interpersonal mental health cognition academic dysfunction suggesting smartphone use result significant negative consequences individuals see review Billieux example although smartphones provide unique opportunities social interaction Scott et al found problematic attachment technology smartphone devices associated lowered social skills emotional intelligence empathy well increased conflict others Additionally Laramie identified social anxiety loneliness associated heavy use reliance upon mobile phones suggesting smartphone overuse may result interpersonal dysfunction Relatedly selfreported subjective smartphone addiction shown negatively correlated psychological wellbeing Kumcagiz Gndz Several studies revealed evidence low selfesteem Bianchi Phillips Hong et al depression anxiety DeSola et al b Elhai et al Matar Boumosleh Jaalouk associated problematic smartphone use especially populations adolescents young adults results studies present rationale justified concern surrounding potential negative psychological consequences smartphone overuse Similarly concern grown potential negative impacts smartphone use might users behavior cognitive abilities Research shown problematic smartphone use related impulsivity Contractor et al DeSola et al b Hadar et al impaired attention Roberts et al Hadar et al compromised inhibitory control Chen et al associated cognitive deficits spurred researchers investigate potential dysfunction academic performance well Smartphone use shown negatively correlate academic progress success Alosaimi et al Hawi Samaha Samaha Hawi Findings studies suggest cognitive dysfunction associated smartphone overuse may result realworld consequences individuals reiterate despite research efforts characterizing associated dysfunction standardized conceptualization problematic smartphone use yet established field However previously described areas dysfunction eg social interpersonal mental health cognition academia found associated smartphone use support Billieuxs conceptualization problematic smartphone use contingent upon negative consequences associated use many assessment tools problematic use tap types negative life consequences likely identify individuals excessive smartphone use especially harmful Smartphone Addiction Real Concept American Psychiatric Association APA broadly defines addiction complex condition brain disease manifested compulsive substance use despite harmful consequences pg American Psychiatric Association definition use substances requirement condition addicted one must substance addicted behavioral addictions Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders DSM American Psychiatric Association International Classification Diseases ICD World Health Organization grouped behavioral addictions within respective substance dependence categories Recategorization addictions seen DSM resulting gambling disorder recognized nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder American Psychiatric Association Additionally Internet Gaming Disorder IGD included DSM condition study American Psychiatric Association Finally gambling disorder gaming disorder grouped together ICD World Health Organization suggesting behavioral addictions share common ground substance use disorders SUD Despite conceptual similarity Billieux et al argue addictive behaviors like problematic smartphone use associated several types associated dysfunction research arena inconsistent documenting significant behavioral neurobiological similarities correlates widely recognized substance addictions example many features substance addiction appear present considering excessive smartphone use little research documented presence loss control ie trouble consciously limiting ones smartphone use tolerance ie increasing smartphone use achieve satisfaction withdrawal ie negative symptoms occur smartphone use discontinuation Billieux et al Also dependence symptoms tolerance withdrawal theoretically based physiological adaptation increasing amounts drug often absent behavioral addictions review IGD Kaptsis et al find consistent answers questions inquiring withdrawal symptoms effects mood ie feeling irritable dissatisfied moody unable play game IGD Similarly physiological neurobiological adaptations increasing amounts smartphone use yet documented suggesting researchers may need use criterion define problematic smartphone use researchers argued borrowing criteria recognized addictive behaviors like substance abuse problematic gambling might fit certain problematic excessive behaviors Starcevic Thus although sharing common ground problematic smartphone use may substantially differ substance addiction regards loss control tolerance withdrawal criteria addiction map better Aforementioned associated life dysfunction becoming increasingly documented meaning problematic use smartphone devices realworld negative consequences individuals Compulsive use documented Parasuraman et al found participants would quit using smartphones even though daily lifestyles negatively affected excessive use irresistible impulse use ones smartphone despite wanting stop reminiscent individuals SUDs drive use drugs overrides executive control processes Six symptom criteria even proposed diagnose smartphone addiction related functional impairment based guidelines SUDs IGD Lin et al dropped tolerance final criterion due low diagnostic accuracy However included withdrawal subjects used smartphones excessively enough considered addicted displayed feelings dysphoria anxiety andor irritability period without smartphones Dependency appears extent excess smartphone users although based subjective selfreport study conducted Parasuraman et al analyzing smartphone use behavior almost smartphone users reported feeling dependent upon smartphone devices users felt though unable withstand smartphone Additionally participants indicated use smartphone longer intended Similarly results research study released Sun newspaper March indicated one ten college students say addicted smartphones Hope Upon surveying college students students endorsed question constantly checking smartphones figure time students responded sleep smartphones lying beside data indicate used excessively smartphones become problematic users report feeling though addiction Laws even enacted many states combat problematic use Phone use driving vehicle become major concern shown anticipation incoming calls messages notifications directly correlates greater invehicle phone use OConnor et al Additionally recently city Honolulu Hawaii even gone far enact law making illegal pedestrians use phones crossing street highway Honolulu Hawaii Ordinance Bill due significant increase pedestrian fatalities city partially attributed smartphone distraction Ellis Thus individuals using smartphones risky physically hazardous situations conceptually similar recognized addiction criteria SUDs DSM DSM Criteria Considerations reviewed problematic smartphone use shares conceptual similarities typically recognized addictions including excessive use failure impulse control feelings dependency use risky andor physically hazardous situations potential negative affect using ones smartphone term addiction typically characterized criterion question whether behavioral addictions must contain criterion considered true addiction still debate Starcevic suggested behavioral addictions characterized salient behaviors promote craving neglect life activity loss control tolerance withdrawal manifestations negative consequences overuse Gambling disorder considered impulse control disorder DSMIV American Psychiatric Association characterized grouped SUDs recent DSM American Psychiatric Association new category psychopathology entitled SubstanceRelated Addictive Disorders transition result wide body research demonstrating clinical phenomenological genetic neurobiological similarities gambling disorder SUDs Potenza gambling disorder currently representative member NonSubstanceRelated Disorders subsection transition important shift recognition behavioral addictions broadly Many researchers advocate similar recognition problematic smartphone use eg Potenza et al Support recognition problematic smartphone use also motivated growing body research

conducted Internet addiction greatly influenced investigation problematic smartphone use similar disorder light growing concerns surrounding known unknown implications smartphone use well recent

smartphone use behavior opposed contemporary mobile phone devices Scales included Table specifically developed validated identify problematic smartphone mobile phone use diagnose individuals smartphone addiction overuse dependency attachment etc eg Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b Smartphone Addiction Inventory SPAI Lin et al Although construct claimed measured individual scales may differ many similar theoretical foundations even item content example Kwon et al b utilized DSMIV criteria substance dependence develop item content SAS goal assessing addiction Merlo et al utilized criteria develop Problematic Use Mobile Phones PUMP scale Table validated shortened versions originally validated scales included review identified literature review Table includes majority scales identified review Table hand contains three scales table includes scales assessing smartphone use frequency opposed general problematic smartphone use behavior important note differences two constructs described earlier smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use Elhai et al Higher frequency smartphone use may indicate presence problematic smartphone use example associated life dysfunction identified Billieux Scales included table include Media Technology Usage Attitudes Scale MTUAS Rosen et al assesses use technological devices including smartphones attitudes surrounding technology use see Table Smartphone Use Frequency SUF Elhai et al assessing use smartphone devices areas calling messaging emailing etc Mobile Usage Scale MUS Konok et al examining differences use smartphones traditional mobile phones scales included review provide researchers options examining problematic smartphone use andor smartphone use frequency Finally additional scales assessing motivations well attitudes surrounding use smartphone devices included Table example MTUAS Rosen et al included Tables although assesses frequency smartphone technology usage also examines attitudes associated usage Additionally Process vs Social Smartphone Usage Scale PSSU van Deursen et al included Table due examination motivations use smartphone devices Finally third example scale included Table Mobile Phone Affinity Scale MPAS Bock et al evaluates motivations smartphone use including connectedness productivity empowerment etc important include six scales Table inclusion exemplifies robust nature research development measurement scales focusing smartphone use inclusion three domains makes review useful tool researchers studying smartphone use behavior problematic otherwise well associated benefits dysfunction Psychometric Characteristics Elements criterionrelated validity content domains internal consistency temporal stability purported construct listed briefly described scales Tables tables used compare individual scales Additionally following analysis psychometric properties conceptual foundations scales included review dissected analysis help researchers practitioners alike consider psychometric properties theoretical foundations potential assessment tools deciding scale utilized research practice term addiction used frequently naming many problematic smartphone use scales due choice framework criterionrelated validity used developing validating scales Many scale developers used either DSMIV DSM criteria substance use examine criterionrelated validity development Others chose use Griffiths components descriptive model addiction includes following core components salience mood modification tolerance withdrawal conflict relapse Similarly Internet addiction frequently used establish criterionrelated validity release first smartphone problematic Internet use observed identified subsequently labeled Internet addiction Addiction scales quickly developed assist identifying behavior Youngs Internet Addiction Test IAT YScale Young smartphones developed made available public problematic smartphone use similarly became concern Many researchers utilized various Internet addiction scales validate scales eg SMSPUDQ ECPUS MPAI SAPS One final ways scale developers established criterionrelated validity utilizing quantified smartphone use criterion determine whether scales could used identify smartphone addiction However scale development processes involved selfreported selfestimated smartphone use unable utilize concrete exact documentation participants smartphone use time relied upon estimation unreliable Andrews et al therefore considered practical accurate means validating scale Even accurate data obtained participants concerning time spent using phones established cutoff point used validate accuracy scale indicating dependency problematic use addiction based upon extensiveness use alone since determined point phone use becomes problematic likely cutoff point quantitative smartphone use may feasible Elhai et al explains smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use describe high frequency smartphone use functional eg productive smartphone use purposes work school dysfunctional others eg excessive gaming social media use Additionally significant number scales described Tables relied upon existing measurement scales problematic phone use order establish concurrent validity scale developing due recognized issue currently gold standard criterionrelated validity problematic phone use addiction However concerning considering existing assessments used validate new scale likely also used problematic criteria establish criterionrelated validity example developing Smartphone Impact Scale SIS Pancani et al included widely used Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b study validate SIS Italian adult sample could problematic two reasons Firstly knowledge SAS yet validated use Italian adults developed using population Korean adults Secondly knowledge temporal stability SAS yet investigated Selection content domains researchers validation studies stemmed conceptual foundation scales development criterionrelated validity example regarding scales Table DSMIV pathological gambling criteria DSM gambling disorder criteria used establish criterionrelated validity seven scales COS MPAI CERM KBUTK MAT AMPUH ATeMo Therefore scales content domains shown reflect diagnostic criteria associated problematic gambling disorder DSM indicates diagnosed gambling disorder individual must exhibit four following symptoms tolerance withdrawal lack control preoccupation escape problems chasing losses deception associated life dysfunction areas relationships job education finances American Psychiatric Association Excluding chasing losses factors shown consistently reflected across seven scales terms established content domains DSMIV DSMIVTR DSM criteria SUDs frequently used validate problematic smartphone use scales diagnostic criteria similarly reflected content domains established validation studies eg CERM PCPUQ SAS Internal consistency degree interrelatedness among scale items Mokkink et al measure reliability reported scales form Cronbachs value However despite importance scale development internal consistency value reported seven scales validation studies STDS DENA MPIQ MAT MPUQ MIUI SAMI Cronbachs values reported ranged MPUS PMUM MTUAS SAS Although inconsistency field regarding point Cronbachs values considered adequate acceptable acceptable values alpha reported range Nunnally Bernstein Bland Altman DeVellis Using lowest value reported acceptable adequate cutoff four scales identified review PMPUQ IMAT MPUS MTUAS would meet standard Although internal consistency important scale development scale developers failed account temporal stability guaranteeing reliability Upon analyzing psychometric properties various scales discovered scale development ten scales testretest reliability coefficients provided indicate scales temporal stability cause concern even frequently used scales failed ensure temporal stability development eg SAS NMPQ SABAS Discussion review first identify report method development problematic smartphone use scales well developed assess smartphone use frequency motivations attitudes conducting systematic search identifying relevant measures analyzed psychometric properties criterionrelated validity scale However despite identifying validated scales able fully determine efficient scales measuring problematic phone usage due several issues scales established criterion validity using DSMIV DSM criteria gambling disorder substanceuse disorders even though still considerable controversy whether problematic smartphone use considered addiction testretest reliability coefficients reported development articles scales internal consistency testretest reliability available seven scales causes concern future analyses attempt identify efficient scales goldstandard criteria cutoff scores problematic smartphone use yet established words scales accurately compared contrasted since validated goldstandard criteria strive incorporate Therefore primarily discuss practical ideas recommendations future research Scale Content addition gambling disorder substancerelated addictive disorders section DSM nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder subsequently opened door behaviors researched evaluated identified developed validated scales Another example would behavioral condition known internet gaming disorder IGD area research warrants study according DSM American Psychiatric Association proposed criteria IGD behavioral addiction involving problematic use video game technology closely resembles criteria SUD similar researchers conceptualizing problematic smartphone use Lin et al based development methods majority reviewed scales many researchers feel though could time start assessing smartphone use addictive framework mind arguably exception tolerance symptoms Lin et al may part due belief problematic smartphone use well potentially problematic behaviors similarly characterized defined diagnosable behavioral nonsubstancerelated addictions majority reviewed scales reflect viewpoint content domain scales see Table related dependencerelated concepts including craving tolerance withdrawal excessive time spent using negative life consequences scales moved away content domain development attempted measure specific different aspects problematic smartphone use example Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire Walsh et al Media Technology Usage Attitudes Scale Rosen et al examine smartphone use involvement items assessing euphoria salience overall usage perhaps reflects rationale smartphones may especially cognitively behaviorally salient resulting usage without usage necessarily pathological uncontrollable addictive nature scales perhaps measure construct liking pleasurable impact habitual smartphone use compared scales measuring construct wanting compulsive motivation engage smartphone use resulting negative life consequences reflects important distinction considering behavioral addiction framework todays society smartphones linked several forms reward social value makes sense people would like smartphones feel important use many times day necessarily reflect addiction despite individuals tendency selfreport reviewed scales perhaps better conceptualized measuring maladaptive smartphone use rather addictive use endorsements behaviors perhaps rise severity levels addiction Panova Carbonell similar vein scales appear measure degree individuals report salient emotional connections smartphone Young Adult Attachment Phone Scale Trub Barbot Adolescent Preoccupations Screens Scale Hunter et al share item content related feelings safety feelings anxiety without ones phone scales measure attachment styles individuals mood state shift depending smartphone devices proximity relative convenience smartphone functions daily life mean feelings irritation concern likely present one immediate access Relatedly scales like Mobile Attachment Scale Konok et al Mobile Phone Affinity Scale Bock et al items measure preference mobile communication resulting strong preferences ones smartphone device instantly accessible emotional attachment resulting dysphoria mimic addiction withdrawal symptoms way Problematic smartphone use often cooccurs depression anxiety means experiential avoidance Elhai et al scales criteria may simply reflecting strong liking ease communication others via callingtexting result different emotional reactions depending whether device accessible Future research examine endorsement particular problematic smartphone use behaviors perhaps better explained general psychopathology like depression anxiety rather addiction Numerous researchers published scales purportedly assessing smartphone addiction phone addiction However researchers feel though currently necessary evidence supported research accurately conceptualize smartphone use capability developing addictive behavior Griffiths argues yet position confirm existence serious persistent psychopathological addictive disorder related mobile phone addiction basis population survey data alone p Perhaps reason standard cutoff point determine smartphone use becomes problematic yet established Similarly Internet addiction framework frequently used developers several reviewed problematic smartphone use scales establish criterionrelated validity However Internet addiction currently recognized DSM nonsubstance related addictive disorder due lack research indicating similarity manifestation dysfunction addictive disorders recognized DSM Additionally lack sufficient research investigating effectively characterize problematic smartphone use currently unclear whether problematic ought defined quantity use patterns use negative consequences marked distress result usage researchers intend define problematic smartphone use addiction similar substanceuse disorder three criteria among others eg recurrent use situations physically hazardous continued use despite persistent recurrent social interpersonal problems caused exacerbated use would need present order diagnose dysfunctional problematic smartphone use addiction American Psychiatric Association reflected selfreport scales researchers developing testing validating Panova Carbonell support Griffiths previously described argument similarly suggest moving away addiction framework considering problematic behaviors problematic use smartphone technological devices reference pattern weak study designs smartphone literature full reliance correlational studies lack longitudinal experimental studies examine associated cognitive psychological behavior dysfunction also strongly advocate use terms problematic use addiction describing behaviors noted imperative researchsupported criterion problematic smartphone use identified using officially recognized addictive disorders establish criterionrelated validity Limitations Reviewed Scales addition many fundamental limitations development intended uses reviewed scales instance reviewed scales assessed phone use selfreport therefore reliably measure actual phone usage limitation particular field research needs addressed developing new scales many researchers hypotheses creating scales problematic phone use would correlate actual use instead associated personality traits including selfesteem impulsivity eg Bianchi Phillips Billieux et al Leung Future research may aim develop modify existing scale consider running experimental study actively measure phone usage among individuals includes method separate normal problematic use Interestingly global researchers Monge Roffarello De Russis well Google recently created smartphone applications eg Socialize Digital Wellbeing track phone usage among features even provide intervention excessive use eg allowing users set limits amount time allotted specific application usage per week per day applications excellent examples researchers consider using alternative selfreport scales measuring smartphone usage research setting applications would provide investigators opportunity gather objective data smartphone use smartphoneusing participants following instruction application downloaded participants phones specific period time Future research ought also investigate effectiveness applications intervention tools problematic smartphone use However reiterate due heterogeneity smartphone use frequency ie functional versus dysfunctional described Elhai et al researchers recognize objective smartphone use data collected use applications methods measure smartphone use frequency necessarily problematic smartphone use Additionally necessary steps ought taken safeguard ethical considerations minimize risks associated instructing participants download applications smartphone devices inherent function tracking activity eg protection privacy Secondly majority development articles reviewed scales reported internal consistency means establishing reliability scale Internal consistency widely used scale development coefficient based interrelatedness items within scale However mean items whole necessarily related intended construct possess established validity going rank scales reliable based solely internal consistency coefficients PMUM MTUAS SAS would top list However researchers Thompson called use internal consistency sole measure reliability sloppy representative quality scale higher Cronbachs alpha may demonstrate consistency items measure items may accurately capturing problematic phone usage reliability validity statistics offered development articles reviewed scales perhaps specific scales could recommended confidence review future use Thirdly large amount variability types samples studied development articles makes difficult compare utility scale following interpreted limitations instead interesting findings diverse origin subjects studied scales development instance small percentage studies conducted participants United States many scales written languages besides English example many six scales developed Chinese WEUS PSUMS MPAI SASC SQAPMPU MPATS four Turkish MAS PMPUS PS PMPUS seven Korean ECPUS CPAS SAPS SAI SAS SASSV SOSQ Based research conducted Pew Research Center South Korea largest percentage smartphone owners Therefore large number scales developed within population understandable Yet also several scales developed Englishspeaking areas outside United States Australia MMPUS IMAT APSS MPIQ United Kingdom PMPUQR information viewed Tables Appendix Lastly intended use reviewed scales varied depending theoretical models criteria upon based scales intended measure problematic use addiction dependence excessive use mobile phones instance Leung one earliest developers mobile phone index used measure addiction symptoms demonstrated mobile users based construction MPAI idea adolescents started excessively using mobile phones leisure time way counteracting boredom due much time enough type activity labeled leisure boredom shown associated deviant activity negative affect Interestingly large percentage scales purportedly assessing smartphone mobile phone addiction surprising given aforementioned literature opposed labeling problematic smartphone use addiction Griffiths Panova Carbonell Additionally several scales developed hopes used future clinical purposes eg diagnosis problematic smartphone use since mention problematic smartphone use disorder addiction DSMIV DSM ICD seems though authors must become content scales confined research purposes indicates need additional research conceptualization demonstrated severity problematic smartphone use whether given consideration place next edition DSM ICD unable recommend use specific scale specific scales assess behavior due lack sufficient research construct Limitations Current Study review without limitations First databases used systematic search PsycINFO EBSOhost MEDLINE Complete EBSCOhost PsycINFO utilized due specialized database provide unique search results specific topics psychology additionally used several largely cited systematic reviews Bramer et al Elhai et al also utilized MEDLINE Complete database rather PubMed interface due convenience access EBSOhost Secondly many reliability coefficients able listed due many articles published solely foreign language therefore unable identify andor interpret coefficients articles inaccessible simply coefficients reported articles last point may also expressed limitation scales Future Directions Future research must conducted order identify potential cognitive neurological physical behavioral social dysfunction related smartphone use Currently causal relationships smartphone use dysfunction previously listed areas established conceptualizing smartphone use way assert behavior become problematic clinical nature done caution Additionally standard cutoff point smartphone use becomes dysfunctional ought investigated evidence causal relationships smartphone use dysfunction well formulated standardized conceptualization behavior researchers able construct accurate specific scales identifying problematic use Conclusion review serves opportunity compare contrast numerous scales published past years analyze psychometric properties individual scales order determine included scales considered adequate tools assessing problematic smartphone use smartphone addiction However recommended research conducted sufficiently conceptualize behavior development manifestation associated dysfunction order best develop tools assess behavior must first understand smartphone use increased focus contexts functions motivations use

one must substance addicted behavioral addictions Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders DSM American Psychiatric Association International Classification Diseases ICD World Health Organization grouped behavioral addictions within respective substance dependence categories Recategorization addictions seen DSM resulting gambling disorder recognized nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder American Psychiatric Association Additionally Internet Gaming Disorder IGD included DSM condition study American Psychiatric Association Finally gambling disorder gaming disorder grouped together ICD World Health Organization suggesting behavioral addictions share common ground substance use disorders SUD Despite conceptual similarity Billieux et al argue addictive behaviors like problematic smartphone use associated several types associated dysfunction research arena inconsistent documenting significant behavioral neurobiological similarities correlates widely recognized substance addictions example many features substance addiction appear present considering excessive smartphone use little research documented presence loss control ie trouble consciously limiting ones smartphone use tolerance ie increasing smartphone use achieve satisfaction withdrawal ie negative symptoms occur smartphone use discontinuation Billieux et al Also dependence symptoms tolerance withdrawal theoretically based physiological adaptation increasing amounts drug often absent behavioral addictions review IGD Kaptsis et al find consistent answers questions inquiring withdrawal symptoms effects mood ie feeling irritable dissatisfied moody unable play game IGD Similarly physiological neurobiological adaptations increasing amounts smartphone use yet documented suggesting researchers may need use criterion define problematic smartphone use researchers argued borrowing criteria recognized addictive behaviors like substance abuse problematic gambling might fit certain problematic excessive behaviors Starcevic Thus although sharing common ground problematic smartphone use may substantially differ substance addiction regards loss control tolerance withdrawal criteria addiction map better Aforementioned associated life dysfunction becoming increasingly documented meaning problematic use smartphone devices realworld negative consequences individuals Compulsive use documented Parasuraman et al found participants would quit using smartphones even though daily lifestyles negatively affected excessive use irresistible impulse use ones smartphone despite wanting stop reminiscent individuals SUDs drive use drugs overrides executive control processes Six symptom criteria even proposed diagnose smartphone addiction related functional impairment based guidelines SUDs IGD Lin et al dropped tolerance final criterion due low diagnostic accuracy However included withdrawal subjects used smartphones excessively enough considered addicted displayed feelings dysphoria anxiety andor irritability period without smartphones Dependency appears extent excess smartphone users although based subjective selfreport study conducted Parasuraman et al analyzing smartphone use behavior almost smartphone users reported feeling dependent upon smartphone devices users felt though unable withstand smartphone Additionally participants indicated use smartphone longer intended Similarly results research study released Sun newspaper March indicated one ten college students say addicted smartphones Hope Upon surveying college students students endorsed question constantly checking smartphones figure time students responded sleep smartphones lying beside data indicate used excessively smartphones become problematic users report feeling though addiction Laws even enacted many states combat problematic use Phone use driving vehicle become major concern shown anticipation incoming calls messages notifications directly correlates greater invehicle phone use OConnor et al Additionally recently city Honolulu Hawaii even gone far enact law making illegal pedestrians use phones crossing street highway Honolulu Hawaii Ordinance Bill due

recognized addiction criteria SUDs DSM DSM Criteria Considerations reviewed problematic smartphone use shares conceptual similarities typically recognized addictions including excessive use failure impulse control feelings dependency use risky andor physically hazardous situations potential negative affect using ones smartphone term addiction typically characterized criterion question whether behavioral addictions must contain criterion considered true addiction still debate Starcevic suggested behavioral addictions characterized salient behaviors promote craving neglect life activity loss

decreasing smartphones became increasingly popular However transition mobile phone use smartphone era terms mobile phone smartphone used interchangeably across studies often within studies smartphones significantly components capabilities mobile phones problematic use two different forms technology viewed differently comparisons published scales made light distinctive differences two types technology scales arranged based upon date published within three tables starting first developed scale recently published scales Thus likely recently developed scales involved specific analyses smartphone use behavior opposed contemporary mobile phone devices Scales included Table specifically developed validated identify problematic smartphone mobile phone use diagnose individuals smartphone addiction overuse dependency attachment etc eg Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b Smartphone Addiction Inventory SPAI Lin et al Although construct claimed measured individual scales may differ many similar theoretical foundations even item content example Kwon et al b utilized DSMIV criteria substance dependence develop item content SAS goal assessing addiction Merlo et al utilized criteria develop Problematic Use Mobile Phones PUMP scale Table validated shortened versions originally validated scales included review identified literature review Table includes majority scales identified review Table hand contains three scales table includes scales assessing smartphone use frequency opposed general problematic smartphone use behavior important note differences two constructs described earlier smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use Elhai et al Higher frequency smartphone use may indicate presence problematic smartphone use example associated life dysfunction identified Billieux Scales included table include Media Technology Usage Attitudes Scale MTUAS Rosen et al assesses use technological devices including smartphones attitudes surrounding technology use see Table Smartphone Use Frequency SUF Elhai et al assessing use smartphone devices areas calling messaging emailing etc Mobile Usage Scale MUS Konok et al examining differences use smartphones traditional mobile phones scales included review provide researchers options examining problematic smartphone use andor smartphone use frequency Finally additional scales assessing motivations well attitudes surrounding use smartphone devices included Table example MTUAS Rosen et al included Tables although assesses frequency smartphone technology

third example scale included Table Mobile Phone Affinity Scale MPAS Bock et al evaluates motivations smartphone use including connectedness productivity empowerment etc important include six scales Table inclusion exemplifies robust nature research development measurement scales focusing smartphone use inclusion three domains makes review useful tool researchers studying smartphone use behavior problematic otherwise well associated benefits dysfunction Psychometric Characteristics Elements criterionrelated validity content domains internal consistency temporal stability purported construct listed briefly described scales Tables tables used compare individual scales Additionally following analysis psychometric properties conceptual foundations scales included review dissected analysis help researchers practitioners alike consider psychometric properties theoretical foundations potential assessment tools deciding scale utilized research practice term addiction used frequently naming many problematic smartphone use scales due choice framework criterionrelated validity used developing validating scales Many scale developers used either DSMIV DSM criteria substance use examine criterionrelated validity development Others chose use Griffiths components descriptive model addiction includes following core components salience mood modification tolerance withdrawal conflict relapse Similarly Internet addiction frequently used establish criterionrelated validity release first smartphone problematic Internet use observed identified subsequently labeled Internet addiction Addiction scales quickly developed assist identifying behavior Youngs Internet Addiction Test IAT YScale Young smartphones developed made available public problematic smartphone use similarly became concern Many researchers utilized various Internet addiction scales validate scales eg SMSPUDQ ECPUS MPAI SAPS One final ways scale developers established criterionrelated validity utilizing quantified smartphone use criterion determine whether scales could used identify smartphone addiction However scale development processes involved selfreported selfestimated smartphone use unable utilize concrete exact documentation participants smartphone use time relied upon estimation unreliable Andrews et al therefore considered practical accurate means validating scale Even accurate data obtained participants concerning time spent using phones established cutoff point used validate accuracy scale indicating dependency problematic use addiction based upon extensiveness use alone since determined point phone use becomes problematic likely cutoff point quantitative smartphone use may feasible Elhai et al explains smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use describe high frequency smartphone use functional eg productive smartphone use purposes work school dysfunctional others eg excessive gaming social media use Additionally significant number scales described Tables relied upon existing measurement scales problematic phone use order establish concurrent validity scale developing due recognized issue currently gold standard criterionrelated validity problematic phone use addiction However concerning considering existing assessments used validate new scale likely also used problematic criteria establish criterionrelated validity example developing Smartphone Impact Scale SIS Pancani et al included widely used Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b study validate SIS Italian adult sample could problematic two reasons Firstly knowledge SAS yet validated use Italian adults developed using population Korean adults Secondly knowledge temporal stability SAS yet investigated Selection content domains researchers validation studies stemmed conceptual foundation scales development criterionrelated validity example regarding scales Table DSMIV pathological gambling criteria DSM gambling disorder criteria used establish criterionrelated validity seven scales COS MPAI CERM KBUTK MAT AMPUH ATeMo Therefore scales content domains shown reflect diagnostic criteria associated problematic gambling disorder DSM indicates diagnosed gambling disorder individual must exhibit four following symptoms tolerance withdrawal lack control preoccupation escape problems chasing losses deception associated life dysfunction areas relationships job education finances American Psychiatric Association Excluding chasing losses factors shown consistently reflected across seven scales terms established content domains DSMIV DSMIVTR DSM criteria SUDs frequently used validate problematic smartphone use scales diagnostic criteria similarly reflected content domains established validation studies eg CERM PCPUQ SAS Internal consistency degree interrelatedness among scale items Mokkink et al measure reliability reported scales form Cronbachs value However despite importance scale development internal

values considered adequate acceptable acceptable values alpha reported range Nunnally Bernstein Bland Altman DeVellis Using lowest value reported acceptable adequate cutoff four scales identified review PMPUQ IMAT MPUS MTUAS would meet standard Although internal consistency important scale development scale developers failed account temporal stability guaranteeing reliability Upon analyzing psychometric properties various scales discovered scale development ten scales testretest reliability coefficients provided indicate scales temporal stability cause concern even frequently used scales failed ensure temporal stability development eg SAS NMPQ SABAS Discussion review first identify report method development problematic smartphone use scales well developed assess smartphone use frequency motivations attitudes conducting systematic search identifying relevant measures analyzed psychometric properties criterionrelated validity scale However despite identifying validated scales able fully determine efficient scales measuring problematic phone usage due several issues scales established criterion validity using DSMIV DSM criteria gambling disorder substanceuse disorders even though still considerable controversy whether problematic smartphone use considered addiction testretest reliability coefficients reported development articles scales internal consistency testretest reliability available seven scales causes concern future analyses attempt identify efficient scales goldstandard criteria cutoff scores problematic smartphone use yet established words scales accurately compared contrasted since validated goldstandard criteria strive incorporate Therefore primarily discuss practical ideas recommendations future research Scale Content addition gambling disorder substancerelated addictive disorders section DSM nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder subsequently opened door behaviors researched evaluated identified developed validated scales Another example would behavioral condition known internet gaming disorder IGD area research warrants study according DSM American Psychiatric Association proposed criteria IGD behavioral addiction involving problematic use video game technology closely resembles criteria SUD similar researchers conceptualizing problematic smartphone use Lin et al based development methods majority reviewed scales many researchers feel though could time start assessing smartphone use addictive framework mind arguably exception tolerance symptoms Lin et al may part due belief problematic smartphone use well potentially problematic behaviors similarly characterized defined diagnosable behavioral nonsubstancerelated addictions majority reviewed scales reflect viewpoint content domain scales see Table related dependencerelated concepts including craving tolerance withdrawal excessive time spent using negative life consequences scales moved away content domain development attempted measure specific different aspects problematic smartphone use example Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire Walsh et al Media Technology Usage Attitudes Scale Rosen et al examine smartphone use involvement items assessing euphoria salience overall usage perhaps reflects rationale smartphones may especially cognitively behaviorally salient resulting usage without usage necessarily pathological uncontrollable addictive nature scales perhaps measure construct liking pleasurable impact habitual smartphone use compared scales measuring construct wanting compulsive motivation engage smartphone use resulting negative life consequences reflects important distinction considering behavioral addiction framework todays society smartphones linked several forms reward social value makes sense people would like smartphones feel important use many times day necessarily reflect addiction despite individuals tendency selfreport reviewed scales perhaps better conceptualized measuring maladaptive smartphone use rather addictive use endorsements behaviors perhaps rise severity levels addiction Panova Carbonell similar vein scales appear measure degree individuals report salient emotional connections smartphone Young Adult Attachment Phone Scale Trub Barbot Adolescent Preoccupations Screens Scale Hunter et al share item content related feelings safety feelings anxiety without ones phone scales measure attachment styles individuals mood state shift depending smartphone devices proximity relative convenience smartphone functions daily life mean feelings irritation concern likely present one immediate access Relatedly scales like Mobile Attachment Scale Konok et al Mobile Phone Affinity Scale Bock et al items measure preference mobile communication resulting strong preferences ones smartphone device instantly accessible emotional attachment resulting dysphoria mimic addiction withdrawal symptoms way Problematic smartphone use often cooccurs depression anxiety means experiential avoidance Elhai et al scales criteria may simply reflecting strong liking ease communication others via callingtexting result different emotional reactions depending whether device accessible Future research examine endorsement particular problematic smartphone use behaviors perhaps better explained general psychopathology like depression anxiety rather addiction Numerous researchers published scales purportedly assessing smartphone addiction phone addiction However researchers feel though currently necessary evidence supported research accurately conceptualize smartphone use capability developing addictive behavior Griffiths argues yet position confirm existence serious persistent psychopathological addictive disorder related mobile phone addiction basis population survey data alone p Perhaps reason standard cutoff point determine smartphone use becomes problematic yet established Similarly Internet addiction framework frequently used developers several reviewed problematic smartphone use scales establish criterionrelated validity However Internet addiction currently recognized DSM nonsubstance related addictive disorder due lack research indicating similarity manifestation dysfunction addictive disorders recognized DSM Additionally lack sufficient research investigating effectively characterize problematic smartphone use currently unclear whether problematic ought defined quantity use patterns use negative consequences marked distress result usage researchers intend define problematic smartphone use addiction similar substanceuse disorder three criteria among others eg recurrent use situations physically hazardous continued use despite persistent recurrent social interpersonal problems caused exacerbated use would need present order diagnose dysfunctional problematic smartphone use addiction American Psychiatric Association reflected selfreport scales researchers developing testing validating Panova Carbonell support Griffiths previously described argument similarly suggest moving away addiction framework considering problematic behaviors problematic use smartphone technological devices reference pattern weak study designs smartphone literature full reliance correlational studies lack longitudinal experimental studies examine associated cognitive psychological behavior dysfunction also strongly advocate use terms problematic use addiction describing behaviors noted imperative researchsupported criterion problematic smartphone use identified using officially recognized addictive disorders establish criterionrelated validity Limitations Reviewed Scales addition many fundamental limitations development intended uses reviewed scales instance reviewed scales assessed phone use selfreport therefore reliably measure actual phone usage limitation particular field research needs addressed developing new scales many researchers hypotheses creating scales problematic phone use would correlate actual use instead associated personality traits including selfesteem impulsivity eg Bianchi Phillips Billieux et al Leung Future research may aim develop modify existing scale consider running experimental study actively measure phone usage among individuals includes method separate normal problematic use Interestingly global researchers Monge Roffarello De Russis well Google recently created smartphone applications eg Socialize Digital Wellbeing track phone usage among features even provide intervention excessive use eg allowing users set limits amount time allotted specific application usage per week per day applications excellent examples researchers consider using alternative selfreport scales measuring smartphone usage research setting applications would provide investigators opportunity gather objective data smartphone use smartphoneusing participants following instruction application downloaded participants phones specific period time Future research ought also investigate effectiveness applications intervention tools problematic smartphone use However reiterate due heterogeneity smartphone use frequency ie functional versus dysfunctional described Elhai et al researchers recognize objective smartphone use data collected use applications methods measure smartphone use frequency necessarily problematic smartphone use Additionally necessary steps ought taken safeguard ethical considerations minimize risks associated instructing participants download applications smartphone devices inherent function tracking activity eg protection privacy Secondly majority development articles reviewed scales reported internal consistency means establishing reliability scale Internal consistency widely used scale development coefficient based interrelatedness items

started excessively using mobile phones leisure time way counteracting boredom due much time enough type activity labeled leisure boredom shown associated deviant activity negative affect Interestingly large percentage scales purportedly assessing smartphone mobile phone addiction surprising given aforementioned literature opposed labeling problematic smartphone use addiction Griffiths Panova Carbonell Additionally several scales developed hopes used future clinical purposes eg diagnosis problematic smartphone use since mention problematic smartphone use disorder addiction DSMIV DSM ICD seems though authors must become content scales confined research purposes indicates need additional research conceptualization demonstrated severity problematic smartphone use whether given

APA broadly defines addiction complex condition brain disease manifested compulsive substance use despite harmful consequences pg American Psychiatric Association definition use substances requirement condition addicted one must substance addicted behavioral addictions Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders DSM American Psychiatric Association International Classification Diseases ICD World Health Organization grouped behavioral addictions within respective substance dependence categories Recategorization addictions seen DSM resulting gambling disorder recognized nonsubstancerelated addictive disorder American Psychiatric Association Additionally Internet Gaming Disorder IGD included DSM condition study American Psychiatric Association Finally gambling disorder gaming disorder grouped together ICD World Health Organization suggesting behavioral addictions share common ground substance use disorders SUD Despite conceptual similarity Billieux et al argue addictive behaviors like problematic smartphone use associated several types associated dysfunction research arena inconsistent documenting significant behavioral neurobiological similarities correlates widely recognized substance addictions example many features substance addiction appear present considering excessive smartphone use little research documented presence loss control ie trouble consciously limiting ones smartphone use tolerance ie increasing smartphone use achieve satisfaction withdrawal ie negative symptoms occur smartphone use discontinuation Billieux et al Also dependence symptoms tolerance withdrawal theoretically based physiological adaptation increasing amounts drug often absent behavioral addictions review IGD Kaptsis et al find consistent answers questions inquiring withdrawal symptoms effects mood ie feeling irritable dissatisfied moody unable play game IGD Similarly physiological neurobiological adaptations increasing amounts smartphone use yet documented suggesting researchers may need use criterion define problematic smartphone use researchers argued borrowing criteria recognized addictive behaviors like substance abuse problematic gambling might fit certain problematic excessive behaviors Starcevic Thus although sharing common ground problematic smartphone use may substantially differ substance addiction regards loss control tolerance withdrawal criteria addiction map better Aforementioned associated life dysfunction becoming increasingly documented meaning problematic use smartphone devices realworld negative consequences individuals Compulsive use documented Parasuraman et al found participants would quit using smartphones even though daily lifestyles negatively affected excessive use irresistible impulse use ones smartphone despite wanting stop reminiscent individuals SUDs drive use drugs overrides executive control processes Six symptom criteria even proposed diagnose smartphone addiction related functional impairment based guidelines SUDs IGD Lin et al dropped tolerance final criterion due low diagnostic accuracy However included withdrawal subjects used smartphones excessively enough considered addicted displayed feelings dysphoria anxiety andor irritability period without smartphones Dependency appears extent excess smartphone users although based subjective selfreport study conducted Parasuraman et al analyzing smartphone use behavior almost smartphone users reported feeling dependent upon smartphone devices users felt though unable withstand smartphone Additionally participants indicated use smartphone longer intended Similarly results research study released Sun newspaper March indicated one ten college students say addicted smartphones Hope Upon surveying college students students endorsed question constantly checking smartphones figure time students responded sleep smartphones lying beside data indicate used excessively smartphones become problematic users report feeling though addiction Laws even enacted many states combat problematic use Phone use driving vehicle become major concern shown anticipation incoming calls messages notifications directly correlates greater invehicle phone use OConnor et al Additionally recently city Honolulu Hawaii even gone far enact law making illegal pedestrians use phones crossing street highway Honolulu Hawaii Ordinance Bill due significant increase pedestrian fatalities city partially attributed smartphone distraction Ellis Thus individuals using smartphones risky physically hazardous situations conceptually similar recognized addiction criteria SUDs DSM DSM Criteria Considerations reviewed problematic smartphone use shares conceptual similarities typically recognized addictions including excessive use failure impulse control feelings dependency use risky andor physically hazardous situations potential negative affect using ones smartphone term addiction typically characterized criterion question whether behavioral addictions must contain criterion considered true addiction still debate Starcevic suggested behavioral addictions characterized salient behaviors promote craving neglect life activity loss

decreasing smartphones became increasingly popular However transition mobile phone use smartphone era terms mobile phone smartphone used interchangeably across studies often within studies smartphones significantly components capabilities mobile phones problematic use two different forms technology viewed differently comparisons published scales made light distinctive differences two types technology scales arranged based upon date published within three tables starting first developed scale recently published scales Thus likely recently developed scales involved specific analyses smartphone use behavior opposed contemporary mobile phone devices Scales included Table specifically developed validated identify problematic smartphone mobile phone use diagnose individuals smartphone addiction overuse dependency attachment etc eg Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b Smartphone Addiction Inventory SPAI Lin et al Although construct claimed measured individual scales may differ many similar theoretical foundations even item content example Kwon et al b utilized DSMIV criteria substance dependence develop item content SAS goal assessing addiction Merlo et al utilized criteria develop Problematic Use Mobile Phones PUMP scale Table validated shortened versions originally validated scales included review identified literature review Table includes majority scales identified review Table hand contains three scales table includes scales assessing smartphone use frequency opposed general problematic smartphone use behavior important note differences two constructs described earlier smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use Elhai et al Higher frequency smartphone use may indicate presence problematic smartphone use example associated life dysfunction identified Billieux Scales included table include Media Technology Usage Attitudes Scale MTUAS Rosen et al assesses use technological devices including smartphones attitudes surrounding technology use see Table Smartphone Use Frequency SUF Elhai et al assessing use smartphone devices areas calling messaging emailing etc Mobile Usage Scale MUS Konok et al examining differences use smartphones traditional mobile phones scales included review provide researchers options examining problematic smartphone use andor smartphone use frequency Finally additional scales assessing motivations well attitudes surrounding use smartphone devices included Table example MTUAS Rosen et al included Tables although assesses frequency smartphone technology

third example scale included Table Mobile Phone Affinity Scale MPAS Bock et al evaluates motivations smartphone use including connectedness productivity empowerment etc important include six scales Table inclusion exemplifies robust nature research development measurement scales focusing smartphone use inclusion three domains makes review useful tool researchers studying smartphone use behavior problematic otherwise well associated benefits dysfunction Psychometric Characteristics Elements criterionrelated validity content domains internal consistency temporal stability purported construct listed briefly described scales Tables tables used compare individual scales Additionally following analysis psychometric properties conceptual foundations scales included review dissected analysis help researchers practitioners alike consider psychometric properties theoretical foundations potential assessment tools deciding scale utilized research practice term addiction used frequently naming many problematic smartphone use scales due choice framework criterionrelated validity used developing validating scales Many scale developers used either DSMIV DSM criteria substance use examine criterionrelated validity development Others chose use Griffiths components descriptive model addiction includes following core components salience mood modification tolerance withdrawal conflict relapse Similarly Internet addiction frequently used establish criterionrelated validity release first smartphone problematic Internet use observed identified subsequently labeled Internet addiction Addiction scales quickly developed assist identifying behavior Youngs Internet Addiction Test IAT YScale Young smartphones developed made available public problematic smartphone use similarly became concern Many researchers utilized various Internet addiction scales validate scales eg SMSPUDQ ECPUS MPAI SAPS One final ways scale developers established criterionrelated validity utilizing quantified smartphone use criterion determine whether scales could used identify smartphone addiction However scale development processes involved selfreported selfestimated smartphone use unable utilize concrete exact documentation participants smartphone use time relied upon estimation unreliable Andrews et al therefore considered practical accurate means validating scale Even accurate data obtained participants concerning time spent using phones established cutoff point used validate accuracy scale indicating dependency problematic use addiction based upon extensiveness use alone since determined point phone use becomes problematic likely cutoff point quantitative smartphone use may feasible Elhai et al explains smartphone use frequency heterogeneous due differing motivations purposes use describe high frequency smartphone use functional eg productive smartphone use purposes work school dysfunctional others eg excessive gaming social media use Additionally significant number scales described Tables relied upon existing measurement scales problematic phone use order establish concurrent validity scale developing due recognized issue currently gold standard criterionrelated validity problematic phone use addiction However concerning considering existing assessments used validate new scale likely also used problematic criteria establish criterionrelated validity example developing Smartphone Impact Scale SIS Pancani et al included widely used Smartphone Addiction Scale SAS Kwon et al b study validate SIS Italian adult sample could problematic two reasons Firstly knowledge SAS yet validated use Italian adults developed using population Korean adults Secondly knowledge temporal stability SAS yet investigated Selection content domains researchers validation studies stemmed conceptual foundation scales development criterionrelated validity example regarding scales Table DSMIV pathological gambling criteria DSM gambling disorder criteria used establish criterionrelated validity seven scales COS MPAI CERM KBUTK MAT AMPUH ATeMo Therefore scales content domains shown reflect diagnostic criteria associated problematic gambling disorder DSM indicates diagnosed gambling disorder individual must exhibit four following symptoms tolerance withdrawal lack control preoccupation escape problems chasing losses deception associated life

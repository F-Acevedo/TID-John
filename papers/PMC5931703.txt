particularly conducted time Hg exposures substantially higher occurs today modern workplace failure describe detailed findings including relevant negative results lack statistical evaluations using

domains Thus could document doserelatedness estimate response thresholds small number PE NB EPS effects general doserelatedness response thresholds could determined specific tests used various studies Another limitation various studies reported urine measures differing ways eg g HgL g Hgg creatinine g Hg per hours requiring values converted common metric enable comparisons across studies discussed methods section conversions gL made using midpoint range reported creatinine concentration urinary volume However also performed conversions using alternatives conversion factors ie lower upper bounds creatinine concentration gL urinary excretion rates L hrs alter conclusions review also considered possibility inclusion criterion exposure Hg generally least months might biased results Based literature review choice three month criterion seemed reasonable example ACGIH repeatedly summarized evidence following onset exposure Hg latency period urinary excretion reflects renal accumulation Hg threshold reached urine Hg understates body burden ACGIH estimates latency take days high exposure six months low exposure ACGIH studies considered involved either highdose exposures thus would shorter latency periods lowerdose exposures longer three months three month criterion seemed appropriate studies reviewed described exposures months eight studies specifically report duration exposure

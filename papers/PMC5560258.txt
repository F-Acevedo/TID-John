adenocarcinoma recurrence patient whose original pathologic findings noninvasive perhaps attributable incomplete initial pathologic review finding thereby suggests resection nonmalignant disease curative patients MCNassociated adenocarcinoma tumor behavior biological features appear distinct typical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma lymph node positivity rate series low literature year

typical pancreatic adenocarcinoma median survival far less years reported months whereas present series MCNassociated carcinoma median survival extended beyond years finding suggests perhaps distinct malignant tumors differing outcomes MCNassociated adenocarcinoma typically resected earlier disease knowledge study represents first multiinstitutional Western study latitude conducted population undergoing MCN resection publication criteria define MCNs ovarian stroma Thus likely timeframe academic institutions MCNs diagnosed using pathologic criteria however given scope scale project across different centers pathologic rereview feasible confirm presence ovarian stroma cases Apart application pathologic criteria ability distinguish IPMNs MCNs diagnostic certainty imaging preoperative laboratories cytologic testing limited without strictly applying pathologic criteria define MCNs IPMNs misclassified MCNs thereby contaminate series MCNs strictly used criteria Therefore possibility exists series well includes patients IPMNs however contamination represents clinical reality time point physicians determining treatment strategies patients pathologic diagnostic criteria determined postoperatively examination surgical specimens pathologic criteria available thereby applicable management decisions patients preoperatively Thus inclusion patients diagnosed MCNs strictly defined ovarian stroma appropriate also represents clinical reality addition study Gil et al examined MCNs diagnosed criteria compared MCNs less stringently diagnosed differences found demographics invasive cancer rates outcomes groups study limited retrospective design included patients underwent resection MCNs thus natural history disease patients undergo resection could studied addition series includes patients underwent resection could potential selection bias patients aggressive MCNs Radiographic rereview conducted thus data gathered solely radiologic reports crosssectional imaging andor endoscopic ultrasonography missing data treated unknown data points Patients treated centers across United States diagnostic treatment algorithms standardized However diversity potential differences among practice patterns across institutions also represents strength results likely generalized US population treated academic institutions nationally Conclusions Adenocarcinoma HGD present resected

resection appropriate surgical candidates IPMNs duct dilation described risk factor malignancy Similarly found MCNs pancreatic ductal dilation represents imaging finding creates concern malignancy aforementioned risk factors sex location radiographic size MCN mural nodularity ductal dilation could considered management strategies patients MCNs IPMNs perhaps patients MCNs need undergo resection could kept radiographic surveillance Furthermore patients preoperatively identified lowrisk MCNs may candidates parenchymasparing procedures rather formal oncologic resections recommendation seems appropriate present series published literature resection MCN invasive component generally represents curative procedure events recurrence resection extraordinarily rare isolated reports diffuse peritoneal recurrence operative rupture noninvasive MCNs one instance adenocarcinoma recurrence patient whose original pathologic findings noninvasive perhaps attributable incomplete initial pathologic review finding thereby suggests resection nonmalignant disease curative patients MCNassociated adenocarcinoma tumor behavior biological features appear distinct typical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma lymph node positivity rate series low literature year survival present series reported previously Historically typical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma aggressive disease process fourth leading cause cancerrelated mortality men women United States typical pancreatic adenocarcinoma median survival far less years reported months whereas present series MCNassociated carcinoma median survival extended beyond years finding suggests perhaps distinct malignant tumors differing outcomes MCNassociated adenocarcinoma typically resected earlier disease knowledge study represents first multiinstitutional Western study latitude conducted population undergoing MCN resection publication criteria define MCNs ovarian stroma Thus likely timeframe academic institutions MCNs diagnosed using pathologic criteria however given scope scale project across different centers pathologic rereview feasible confirm presence ovarian stroma cases Apart application pathologic criteria ability distinguish IPMNs MCNs diagnostic certainty imaging preoperative laboratories cytologic testing limited without strictly applying pathologic criteria define MCNs IPMNs misclassified MCNs thereby contaminate series MCNs strictly used criteria Therefore possibility exists series well includes patients IPMNs however contamination represents clinical reality time point physicians determining treatment strategies patients pathologic diagnostic criteria determined postoperatively examination surgical specimens pathologic criteria available thereby applicable management decisions patients preoperatively Thus inclusion patients diagnosed MCNs strictly defined ovarian stroma appropriate also represents clinical reality addition study Gil et al examined MCNs diagnosed criteria compared MCNs less stringently diagnosed differences found demographics invasive cancer rates outcomes groups study limited retrospective design included patients underwent resection MCNs thus natural history disease patients undergo resection could studied addition series includes patients underwent resection could potential selection bias patients aggressive MCNs Radiographic rereview conducted thus data gathered solely radiologic reports crosssectional imaging andor endoscopic ultrasonography missing data treated unknown data points Patients treated centers across United States diagnostic treatment algorithms standardized However diversity potential differences among practice patterns across institutions also represents strength results likely generalized US population treated academic institutions nationally Conclusions Adenocarcinoma HGD present resected pancreatic MCNs risks include male sex pancreatic head neck location larger radiographic size MCN solid component mural nodule

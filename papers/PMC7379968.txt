dependent upon ability bind retain water skins surface believe improvements made traditional containing unaltered HA advanced containing altered HA AcHA topical humectants contain sodium hyaluronate water may bind well previously assumed water content topical humectants quickly evaporate warm skin surface depending influence RH temperature leaving dehydrated product film along HA nonvolatile ingredients Others pursued improving topical humectant performance modifying HA covalently bonded crosslinking structures covalently bonded hydrophobic modifications eg AcHA Although altered forms HA offer superior hydration benefits compared traditional linear HA combine properties improved water binding crosslinking improved affinity skins surface hydrophobic modifications However theorized greater water binding improved affinity skin deposition could achieved development IPN addition wanted development superior IPNbased humectant simplified involve reactive chemistries potentially hazardous compounds eg formaldehyde glutaraldehyde divinyl sulfone suited standard finished cosmetic product manufacturing US Patent Publication US BIn designing superhumectant pursued creation IPN

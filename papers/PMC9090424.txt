TUS de suicidalidad Un gran porcentaje de son facilitadas por drogas alcohol ASFDA deteriorando la memoria del trauma afectando la aplicacin de tratamientos basados en la evidencia pesar de estos problemas pocos han investigado las necesidades de salud mental SM especficas de los ASFDA Objetivo Los objetivos de este estudio fueron primero identificar las secuelas psicolgicas que caracterizan las ASFDA para explicar por qu los sntomas han sido refractarios al tratamiento Para ello se compar sobrevivientes una ingestin involuntaria de sustancias forzada encubierta ASFDAI una ingestin voluntaria ASFDAV una noASFDA segundo determinar cmo el deterioro de la memoria del trauma se relaciona con el desarrollo de sntomas del TEPT depresin Mtodo Se presentan los datos de una revisin retrospectiva de las historias clnicas de adultos que recibieron servicios de SM por en un centro de trauma para pacientes ambulatorios La muestra incluye una cohorte de aos en donde los casos de fueron vistos de forma aguda en un centro urbano de tratamiento para violacin El estudio es uno de los primeros ms de los estudios de casos en examinar los registros de terapia por ASFDA Se realizaron anlisis de regresin logstica Poisson binomial negativa de datos cuantitativos un anlisis temtico cualitativo de las cogniciones del trauma los puntos clave del tratamiento Resultados Los ASFDAV tuvieron cinco veces ms probabilidades de TUS de un notable sentimiento de culpa relacionado con las sustancias comparado con los ASFDAI Las ASFDA tenan problemas de relacin importantes sentimientos de culpa por haber pasado por alto el peligro de que el agresor se drogara Los sobrevivientes con deterioro de la memoria traumtica tuvieron significativamente menos sntomas de hiperactivacin del TEPT en general especficamente menos hipervigilancia se encontraron diferencias en los sntomas de reexperimentacin Conclusin El deterioro de la memoria traumtica es comn en las ASFDA se asocia con menos hiperactivacin de base sntomas postraumticos en general pesar de esto los problemas de los ASFDA incluyen los sntomas de reexperimentacin que son particularmente angustiantes que restan la capacidad de conectar cognitivamente las intrusiones por lo que contribuyen aumentar las necesidades de tratamiento El deterioro de la memoria limita la aplicacin de tratamientos basados en la evidencia en conjunto estos hallazgos exigen el desarrollo de protocolos de tratamiento especficos para trauma para mejorar la recuperacin de los sobrevivientes las ASFDA PALABRAS CLAVE agresin sexual facilitada

examinar los registros de terapia por ASFDA Se realizaron anlisis de regresin logstica Poisson binomial negativa de datos cuantitativos un anlisis temtico cualitativo de las cogniciones del trauma los puntos clave del tratamiento Resultados Los ASFDAV tuvieron cinco veces ms probabilidades de TUS de un notable sentimiento de culpa relacionado con las sustancias comparado con los ASFDAI Las ASFDA tenan problemas de relacin importantes sentimientos de culpa por haber pasado por alto el peligro de que el agresor se drogara Los sobrevivientes con deterioro de la memoria traumtica tuvieron

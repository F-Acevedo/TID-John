inanimate objects external agents hence every reidentification object gap observation associates observed changes location features object agent even agent unknown someone Infants therefore unavoidable bias towards agency agency invoked whenever reidentify objectIt important emphasize invocation agency required model general conscious Objects typically reidentified within time required

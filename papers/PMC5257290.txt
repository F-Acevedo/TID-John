ACC feasible following factors present solitary tumor diseasefree interval months locoregional pulmonary recurrence Adrenocortical carcinoma ACC rare malignancy incidence approximately per million US Progress management ACC hampered rarity Currently disease typically refractory standard chemotherapy radiation modalities Promising results mitotane treatment initially received enthusiasm however

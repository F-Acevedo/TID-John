responders ATM therapy previous studies demonstrated PKC overexpressed primary NSCLC tumors LSCC tumors PKC expression driven tumorspecific PRKCI amplification current results indicate ATM may particularly effective lung tumors harbor PRKCI amplification since two ATM responsive tumor cell lines study harbor PRKCI amplification finding important implications clinical use ATM since PRKCI amplification PKC overexpression frequent event squamous carcinomas head neck esophagus ovary cervix Thus ATM may effective therapeutic approach tumorsPRKCIPRKCIPRKCIPRKCI PKC overexpression confined tumor cells harboring PRKCI amplification PKC overexpression prevalent LAC LSCC despite fact PRKCI amplification largely confined LSCC tumors Furthermore two SCLC cell lines analyzed overexpress PKC exhibit high ATM sensitivity harbor PRKCI amplification data argue PKC overexpression rather PRKCI gene amplification per se important characteristic ATM response analysis indicates primary NSCLC tumors express PKC levels associated ATM sensitivity observation suggests substantial subset lung cancer patients may benefit ATM therapy Interestingly considered whole LAC LSCC tumors overexpress PKC similar levels However PKC expression profiling individual LAC LSCC tumors reveals different pattern PKC overexpresssion tumor types Whereas majority LSCC tumors overexpress PKC two distinct populations LAC tumors emerge majority LAC cases express relatively low PKC small subset accounting patient cohort express extremely high PKC Based current findings latter subset LAC may particularly

disclosing PrEP usage Newcomb Mongrella Weis McMillen Mustanski participants first time heard PrEP never heard anything PrEP GSN app namethe fact Im learning thing could potentially save life save lot friends lives Im hearing sex app mean makes sense Thats good way advertise itBut surprised never heard Like hasnt anybody else told yearold HIVnegative described hearing positive messages endorsements current PrEP users people living HIV promote risk reduction strategy sex serodiscordant partners lot people promote ittheyre like Oh get find Look Im PrEP Im yearold HIVnegative Yeah lot people people PrEP profile theyre like need figure one lot people promote ones negative theyre like Oh get find Look Im PrEP Im ones positive theyre like long youre PrEP fine yearold HIVnegative However information participants learned app accurate Im like fk PrEP like Well vaccine protects Im like doesnt mean sex willynilly though yearold HIVpositive Mistrust PrEP Many participants described mistrust PrEP Participants speculated whether legitimate effective HIV prevention tool dont trust Interviewer dont trust nice peace mind like insurance Nobody trusts insurance company Nobody believes theyre going actually pay full claim sometimes sometimes dont good peace mind hopefully work dont know Thats kind think yearold HIVnegative participants skeptical authenticity noting HIV preventable also curable dont really know feel cause feel like years try find cure treatment whatever HIV theyre trying find something prevent instead curing yearold HIVnegative shit phonyIts way sure wont get HIV taking PrEP thats whole thing Everybody want PrEP PrEP PrEP guarantee thing make PrEP find cure yearold HIVnegative Participants also described concern promoted PrEP nefarious motivations One guy asked taken PREP like think like one things thatthats people trying set Like trying set gay set gay people dont believe dont like medicationTheyre trying set us probably like HIV late exposure inside medication yearold HIVnegative comments likely reflect medical mistrust general belief HIV conspiracy theories well documented within Black communities associated treatment nonadherence persons living HIV Bogart Wagner Galvan Banks Bogart et al Quinn et al Association sexual promiscuity participants associated PrEP sexual promiscuity high risk behaviors ie condomless intercourse seems like thats copout Thats like copout like thats saying people hey go suck many dicks want yearold HIVnegative makes seem like knowby PrEP makes able sexually free guess yearold HIVnegative Similarly participants also described perception PrEP necessary engaging multiple high risk behaviors mean planned much unprotected sex time like know people would definitely use dont knew person every single day unprotected sex different people multiple people lot groups parties know guys go like bath houses things like absolutely yearold HIVnegative comments reflects ongoing stigma PrEP usage within MSM community including Truvada whore label applied PrEP users Brooks Nieto Landrian Donohoe Mustanski et al relegation PrEP individuals multiple risk behaviors likely represents underestimation among participations HIV acquisition risk Lack protection STIs Many participants described skepticism using PrEP due lack protection STIs Given participants negative statements unprotected sex may reflect preference condoms prevention strategy among population know somebody oh Im PrEP nine times ten men know GSN app name hookup site theyre looking raw sex still like youre smart doesnt prevent STDs yearold HIVpositive PrEP aint going protect chlamydia gonorrhea herpes like youre PrEPing diseases last longer HIV yearold HIVnegative Discussion findings suggest atrisk YBMSM Baltimore aware discussing PrEP generally concerns using grounded medical mistrust stigma concerns STIs PrEP powerful tool interrupt ongoing transmissions incident prevalent networks many YBMSM embedded proper messaging accurate information education needed account negative perceptions surround Without messaging continued underuse priority population expand rather reduce HIV disparities Within population multiple participants described learning PrEP first time interactions users app supports feasibility utilizing GSN apps reach risk YBMSM information PrEP find information participants received users always accurate Furthermore found participants associated PrEP usage sexual promiscuity unprotected intercourse finding reflects negative attitudes PrEP users also misunderstanding PrEP risk eligibility likely underestimation HIV acquisition risk among participants HIV risk underestimation common among youth associated poor PrEP uptake among YBMSM specifically ArringtonSanders Wilson PerumeanChaney Hosek Negative attitudes toward PrEP users also well documented literature barrier uptake many MSM believing PrEP used promiscuous individuals want unprotected intercourse men use PrEP prefer receptive roles sex Brooks et al Mitchell et al Within sample HIVpositive men knew PrEP associated promiscuity negative qualities five HIVnegative men knew PrEP sample small draw conclusions idea HIVpositive men may view potential partners reporting PrEP use negatively merits consideration Furthermore two HIVnegative men associated PrEP promiscuity reported interested taking PrEP due health benefits suggests possible overcome negative associations dispel notion PrEP useful engage regularly high risk behaviors Programs focusing YBMSM include components overcome negative associations frame PrEP terms health benefits YBMSM Previous studies using online technology promote PrEP adherence among YBMSM created private online social media communities peer leaders disseminate educational information Patel et al utilized GSN app profiles answer sexual health questions provide care linkages Patel et al developed webbased health education modules featuring games interactive components Klein et al participants also reported medical mistrust related PrEP including one participant currently taking PrEP skeptical effectiveness prevent HIV wary motives individuals encouraging PrEP uptake attitudes reflect larger issues medical mistrust within Black communities born history racial discrimination within US unethical medical experiments Tuskegee Syphilis Study Bogart et al Bogart et al Quinn et al also found belief HIV conspiracy theories among sample HIV conspiracy theories include belief HIV manmade virus used government control minority populations taking HIV medications government guinea pigs Bogart Thorburn Bogart et al Medical mistrust among Black MSM associated lower knowledge HIV risk reduction strategies detectable viral load disclosing HIV status partners Quinn et al HIV conspiracy beliefs related treatment nonadherence within individuals network may influential espoused network members similar individual known HIVpositive Bogart et al Bogart et al One prior study sought overcome medical mistrust Black community incorporating discrimination disparities HIV misconceptions counselling curriculum Bogart et al However systematic review concluded insufficient evidence effectiveness interventions increase trust doctors Rolfe CashGibson Car Sheikh McKinstry However peerbased strategies described may effective dispelling medical mistrust Finally participants listed concerns contracting STIs reason interested PrEP consistent condom usage estimated effectiveness preventing HIV STI transmission Smith Herbst Zhang Rose research shows condomless intercourse remains prevalent condom usage among MSM may actually decreasing PazBailey et al Among study population least one bacterial STI diagnosis within past year suggests intermittent condom use sample despite negative comments unprotected sex described participants mixed evidence impact PrEP risk behaviors STI rates studies reporting significant decrease condom use rise STI diagnosis others reporting significant effects HightowWeidman et al Molina et al Nguyen et al participants reported presumed association PrEP usage condomless sex among peers unclear presumption true among YBMSM Baltimore BMSM sampled Baltimore reported condom usage last anal sex indicating condom usage may preferred risk reduction method among population German et al Limitations conclusions study drawn purposively selected sample YBMSM Baltimore participants represent priority population often underrepresented research However sample size small recruited specific locations within one midsized city limiting ability draw broad

Conclusions Despite limitations data represent important insights members priority community need targeted PrEP interventions overcome persistent disparities HIV infection PrEP powerful tool interrupt

disclosing PrEP usage Newcomb Mongrella Weis McMillen Mustanski participants first time heard PrEP never heard anything PrEP GSN app namethe fact Im learning thing could potentially save life save lot friends lives Im hearing sex app mean makes sense Thats good way advertise itBut surprised never heard Like hasnt anybody else told yearold HIVnegative described hearing positive messages endorsements current PrEP users people living HIV promote risk reduction strategy sex serodiscordant partners lot people promote ittheyre like Oh get find Look Im PrEP Im yearold HIVnegative Yeah lot people people PrEP profile theyre like need figure one lot people promote ones negative theyre like Oh get find Look Im PrEP Im ones positive theyre like long youre PrEP fine yearold HIVnegative However information participants learned app accurate Im like fk PrEP like Well vaccine protects Im like doesnt mean sex willynilly though yearold HIVpositive Mistrust PrEP Many participants described mistrust PrEP Participants speculated whether legitimate effective HIV prevention tool dont trust Interviewer dont trust nice peace mind like insurance Nobody trusts insurance company Nobody believes theyre going actually pay full claim sometimes sometimes dont good peace mind hopefully work dont know Thats kind think yearold HIVnegative participants skeptical authenticity noting HIV preventable also curable dont really know feel cause feel like years try find cure treatment whatever HIV theyre trying find something prevent instead curing yearold HIVnegative shit phonyIts way sure wont get HIV taking PrEP thats whole thing Everybody want PrEP PrEP PrEP guarantee thing make PrEP find cure yearold HIVnegative Participants also described concern promoted PrEP nefarious motivations One guy asked taken PREP like think like one things thatthats people trying set Like trying set gay set gay people dont believe dont like medicationTheyre trying set us probably like HIV late exposure inside medication yearold HIVnegative comments likely reflect medical mistrust general belief HIV conspiracy theories well documented within Black communities associated treatment nonadherence persons living HIV Bogart Wagner Galvan Banks Bogart et al Quinn et al Association sexual promiscuity participants associated PrEP sexual promiscuity high risk behaviors ie condomless intercourse seems like thats copout Thats like copout like thats saying people hey go suck many dicks want yearold HIVnegative makes seem like knowby PrEP makes able sexually free guess yearold HIVnegative Similarly participants also described perception PrEP necessary engaging multiple high risk behaviors mean planned much unprotected sex time like know people would definitely use dont knew person every single day unprotected sex different people multiple people lot groups parties know guys go like bath houses things like absolutely yearold HIVnegative comments reflects ongoing stigma PrEP usage within MSM community including Truvada whore label applied PrEP users Brooks Nieto Landrian Donohoe Mustanski et al relegation PrEP individuals multiple risk behaviors likely represents underestimation among participations HIV acquisition risk Lack protection STIs Many participants described skepticism using PrEP due lack protection STIs Given participants negative statements unprotected sex may reflect preference condoms prevention strategy among population know somebody oh Im PrEP nine times ten men know GSN app name hookup site theyre looking raw sex still like youre smart doesnt prevent STDs yearold HIVpositive PrEP aint going protect chlamydia gonorrhea herpes like youre PrEPing diseases last longer HIV yearold HIVnegative Discussion findings suggest atrisk YBMSM Baltimore aware discussing PrEP generally concerns using grounded medical mistrust stigma concerns STIs PrEP powerful tool interrupt ongoing transmissions incident prevalent networks many YBMSM embedded proper messaging accurate information education needed account negative perceptions surround Without messaging continued underuse priority population expand rather reduce HIV disparities Within population multiple participants described learning PrEP first time interactions users app supports feasibility utilizing GSN apps reach risk YBMSM information PrEP find information participants received users always accurate Furthermore found participants associated PrEP usage sexual promiscuity unprotected intercourse finding reflects negative attitudes PrEP users also misunderstanding PrEP risk eligibility likely underestimation HIV acquisition risk among participants HIV risk underestimation common among youth associated poor PrEP uptake among YBMSM specifically ArringtonSanders Wilson PerumeanChaney Hosek Negative attitudes toward PrEP users also well documented literature barrier uptake many MSM believing PrEP used promiscuous individuals want unprotected intercourse men use PrEP prefer receptive roles sex Brooks et al Mitchell et al Within sample HIVpositive men knew PrEP associated promiscuity negative qualities five HIVnegative men knew PrEP sample small draw conclusions idea HIVpositive men may view potential partners reporting PrEP use negatively merits consideration Furthermore two HIVnegative men associated PrEP promiscuity reported interested taking PrEP due health benefits suggests possible overcome negative associations dispel notion PrEP useful engage regularly high risk behaviors Programs focusing YBMSM include components overcome negative associations frame PrEP terms health benefits YBMSM Previous studies using online technology promote PrEP adherence among YBMSM created private online social media communities peer leaders disseminate educational information Patel et al utilized GSN app profiles answer sexual health questions provide care linkages Patel et al developed webbased health education modules featuring games interactive components Klein et al participants also reported medical mistrust related PrEP including one participant currently taking PrEP skeptical effectiveness prevent HIV wary motives individuals encouraging PrEP uptake attitudes reflect larger issues medical mistrust within Black communities born history racial discrimination within US unethical medical experiments Tuskegee Syphilis Study Bogart et al Bogart et al Quinn et al also found belief HIV conspiracy theories among sample HIV conspiracy theories include belief HIV manmade virus used government control minority populations taking HIV medications government guinea pigs Bogart Thorburn Bogart et al Medical mistrust among Black MSM associated lower knowledge HIV risk reduction strategies detectable viral load disclosing HIV status partners Quinn et al HIV conspiracy beliefs related treatment nonadherence within individuals network may influential espoused network members similar individual known HIVpositive Bogart et al Bogart et al One prior study sought overcome medical mistrust Black community incorporating discrimination disparities HIV misconceptions counselling curriculum Bogart et al However systematic review concluded insufficient evidence effectiveness interventions increase trust doctors Rolfe CashGibson Car Sheikh McKinstry However peerbased strategies described may effective dispelling medical mistrust Finally participants listed concerns contracting STIs reason interested PrEP consistent condom usage estimated effectiveness preventing HIV STI transmission Smith Herbst Zhang Rose research shows condomless intercourse remains prevalent condom usage among MSM may actually decreasing PazBailey et al Among study population least one bacterial STI diagnosis within past year suggests intermittent condom use sample despite negative comments unprotected sex described participants mixed evidence impact PrEP risk behaviors STI rates studies reporting significant decrease condom use rise STI diagnosis others reporting significant effects HightowWeidman et al Molina et al Nguyen et al participants reported presumed association PrEP usage condomless sex among peers unclear presumption true among YBMSM Baltimore BMSM sampled Baltimore reported condom usage last anal sex indicating condom usage may preferred risk reduction method among population German et al Limitations conclusions study drawn purposively selected sample YBMSM Baltimore participants represent priority population often underrepresented research However sample size small recruited specific locations within one midsized city limiting ability draw broad conclusions YBMSM US data Recruitment study limited residents Baltimore utilizing one GSN app Although selected app due frequent report newly HIVinfected MSM findings may apply YBMSM settings apps Conclusions Despite limitations data represent important insights members priority community need targeted PrEP interventions overcome persistent disparities HIV infection PrEP powerful tool interrupt ongoing transmissions incident prevalent networks many YBMSM embedded proper messaging needed account negative perceptions surround described strategies engage youth online spaces shown promising effects may one medium appropriate messaging dispel negative perceptions observed particularly accurate messaging comes trusted peers research needed without appropriate messaging effective strategies

time heard PrEP never heard anything PrEP GSN app namethe fact Im learning thing could potentially save life save lot friends lives Im hearing sex app mean makes sense Thats good way advertise itBut surprised never heard Like hasnt anybody else told yearold HIVnegative described hearing positive messages endorsements current PrEP users people living HIV promote risk reduction strategy sex serodiscordant partners lot people promote ittheyre like Oh get find Look Im PrEP Im yearold HIVnegative Yeah lot people people PrEP profile theyre like need figure one lot people promote ones negative theyre like Oh get find Look Im PrEP Im ones positive theyre like long youre PrEP fine yearold HIVnegative However information participants learned app accurate Im like fk PrEP like Well vaccine protects Im like doesnt mean sex willynilly though yearold HIVpositive Mistrust PrEP Many participants described mistrust PrEP Participants speculated whether legitimate effective HIV prevention tool dont trust Interviewer dont trust nice peace mind like insurance Nobody trusts insurance company Nobody believes theyre going actually pay full claim sometimes sometimes dont good peace mind hopefully work dont know Thats kind think yearold HIVnegative participants skeptical authenticity noting HIV preventable also curable dont really know feel cause feel like years try find cure treatment whatever HIV theyre trying find something prevent instead curing yearold HIVnegative shit phonyIts way sure wont get HIV taking PrEP thats whole thing Everybody want PrEP PrEP PrEP guarantee thing make PrEP find cure yearold HIVnegative Participants also described concern promoted PrEP nefarious motivations One guy asked taken PREP like think like one things thatthats people trying set Like trying set gay set gay people dont believe dont like medicationTheyre trying set us probably like HIV late exposure inside medication yearold HIVnegative comments likely reflect medical mistrust general belief HIV conspiracy theories well documented within Black communities associated treatment nonadherence persons living HIV Bogart Wagner Galvan Banks Bogart et al Quinn et al Association sexual promiscuity participants associated PrEP sexual promiscuity high risk behaviors ie condomless intercourse seems like thats copout Thats like copout like thats saying people hey go suck many dicks want yearold HIVnegative makes seem like knowby PrEP makes able sexually free guess yearold HIVnegative Similarly participants also described perception PrEP necessary engaging

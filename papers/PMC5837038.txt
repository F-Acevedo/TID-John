electronic medical record coordination allow providers spend less visit time patient education Studies interprofessional teams stressed importance clear definition teammembers role sharing tasks responsibilities professionals along professional tasks allow practice top license found team approach fostered high level interprofessional communication eg pharmacists frequently contacting

interactive continuing education needed optimize longterm outcomes findings may also relevant gout care settings assembling multidisciplinary team practical either pharmacist nurse may take roles played study Limitations study include limited number patients single arm single center involvement study population high educational attainment possible patients lower education levels might benefit less program Future studies larger educationally diverse population valuable Strengths include documentation details pharmacist intervention formal evaluative input subjects providers regarding multiple aspects program Close monitoring rate reaching patients phone length calls assist future analysis phone vs alternative communication strategies program sustained spaced team education appears feasible future modifications could include patient selection specific aspects education monitoring program well focusing program patients felt high risk nonadherence based gout knowledge exam prior nonadherence study suggests several gaps gout patient knowledge including bridge therapy genetic aspects achievability flarefree state irony poor outcomes despite excellent available gout treatment

gout patients Current medical practice moving towards team approach potential optimizing efficiency costsaving maximizing advantages technology program lends well electronic medical record coordination allow providers spend less visit time patient education Studies interprofessional teams stressed importance clear definition teammembers role sharing tasks responsibilities professionals along professional tasks allow practice top license found team approach fostered high level interprofessional communication eg pharmacists frequently contacting providers regarding patients unsure recent medication changes upcoming lab testing timing next appointment Others pointed education critical chronic disease selfmanagement needs combined developing action plan carrying longterm Patients need healthcare team input scheduled visits multidisciplinary team divide labor needed assist patient developing initial action plan well provide monitoring interactive continuing education needed optimize longterm outcomes findings may also relevant gout care settings assembling multidisciplinary team practical either pharmacist nurse may take roles played study Limitations study include limited number patients single arm single center involvement study population high educational attainment possible patients lower education levels might benefit less program Future studies larger educationally diverse population valuable Strengths include documentation details pharmacist intervention formal evaluative input subjects providers regarding multiple aspects program Close monitoring rate reaching patients phone length calls assist future analysis phone vs alternative communication strategies program sustained spaced team education appears feasible future modifications could include patient selection specific aspects education monitoring program well focusing program patients felt high risk nonadherence based gout knowledge exam prior nonadherence study suggests several gaps gout patient knowledge including bridge therapy genetic aspects achievability flarefree state irony poor outcomes despite excellent available gout treatment calls new strategies Significant

Note ART antiretroviral therapy Barriers common groups Overview Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described several common barriers medication adherence including substance use medication side effects unstructured lifestyles Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described psychosocial contexts barriers similarly instance substance use reported barrier groups use substances would increase likelihood forgetting dose Aversion experience side effects led medication avoidance groups Remembering medications difficult groups context unstructured lifestyles typical adolescence young adulthood eg balancing school work college lifestyle late night social outings etc groups also described depression mental health challenges poor risk perception consequences nonadherence medication reminder HIV privacynondisclosure HIV status psychosocial context barriers however described differently behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth Mental health groups described depressed mood common barrier described similar mechanism depressed mood could affect medication adherence example leading low motivation one want anything dont want go work dont want take medicine Behaviorally infected male groups also described depressed mood leading forgetfulness decreased attention treatment regimens One young man felt depression affected willingness stay invested treatment ART theres much emotional turbulence easier stick schedule Behaviorally infected male groups discussed ways depression led apathy fatalism one young woman described Im depressed dont want deal dont want deal HIV couldnt care less living honestly didnt mean anything take medications like die die Perinatally infected female Although experience depression effect adherence similar behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth contextual differences source mood disturbances Perinatally infected youth often described emotional disturbances within families including death parent HIV poor family interactions mother passed away HIV never fully dealt big issue aggravated foster parents aunt also living impression everyone trying take mothers place really trying deal lot things like denialism came along wanting know care remember time didnt take Perinatally infected female Behaviorally infected youth often described emotional psychosocial challenges adjusting new HIV diagnosis impact lives youre depressed wouldnt want take med thats going make depressed Like every time take med honestly feel depressed cause really forget HIV day til go take med like yeah reality check Behaviorally infected male angry HIV angry missing chunks sons life people taking care felt burdened felt like burden people take job parent um fianc working definitely depressed angry wasnt nurses handing medication supposed take wouldnt taken Behaviorally infected transgender male Risk perceptions groups poor risk perception longterm consequences nonadherence manifested inattention consequences prioritizing immediate emotions motivations taking medication Perinatally infected youth risk perceptions based prior experience nonadherence lack negative consequences short term illness rising viral load etc Ive always done really well without part reason stopped taking Im fine without physically viral load CD count would always pretty good Like guess viral load would lower something wasnt great difference Perinatally infected female also described fear death ingrained children take medication Realizing true short term bolstered justifications nonadherence mean youre young used think missed two doses row going die get older realize truth know youre going like get sick die next day Perinatally infected male Risk perceptions behaviorally infected youth typically less treatmentexperienced reflected descriptions general invincibility justifications nonadherence days getwhat call itClark Kent head think Im Superman like know dont really need Behaviorally infected male Reminder HIV ART reminder HIV status groups differences barrier behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth reflected different role HIV status played lives perinatally infected youth taking medication reminder different friends family members Many described reminder normal kind hard cause every day waking taking medicine hard know every day seeing people live normal lives want live normal life cant Perinatally infected male perinatally infected youth medication reminder always different dating back early childhood One youths description daily routine going school nurses office medications illustration point different used Gtube help take meds harder cause take meds school would go nurses office would keep medicines backpack traveling back forth Perinatally infected female behaviorally infected youth starting adhering ART reminder HIV new diagnosis many yet adjusted one young man described told needed start medication HIV status affected wasnt like accepting fact HIV Behaviorally infected male Similarly prospect taking medication also triggered negative emotions associated diagnosed HIV becoming infected One newly infected young transgender man initially avoided ART want think HIVpositive think emotional thing kind reminds every day something youd like think Behaviorally infected transgender male Nondisclosureprivacy groups participants also expressed discomfort disclosing desire privacy HIV status led delaying skipping doses others would see taking carrying medication groups tried avoid stigma associated HIV different dynamics group surrounding HIV stigma Behaviorally infected youth described HIV stigma within social networks avoiding stigma affected adherence behavior Ive fortunate people Ive made friends caring think gay community judgmental although death sentence used still big stigma Behaviorally infected male beginning pharmacy around corner mothers house transferred could get day went go pick found exs best friend pharmacist called um social worker told didnt want get switched still another problem know many people think keepin secret difficult Behaviorally infected male Perinatally infected youth described similar concerns many also described familial culture silence around HIV status prohibited disclosing status outside families discussing status among family members One young woman support mother living HIV fathers silence around HIV insistence secrecy limited sources social support adherence father didnt want people knowing status better keep hidden never really conversations HIV recently years growing never talked basically take medication dont talk Perinatally infected female Barriers specific perinatally infected youth barriers adherence unique perinatally infected youth reflected longer often lifelong experience ART barriers included reactance ie opposition authority figures complicated ART regimens fatigue chronicity HIV challenges transitions independent HIV care many perinatally infected youth taking ART point conflict caregivers medical providers Perinatally infected youth often described nonadherence means exerting control independence caregivers like take take take like OoooK like shut take someones telling take want take want shut think creates factor people thats grow become independent theyre like Fuck shit aint one going tell take going take Perinatally infected female Many described wanting told take medication would respond refusing take participants taking medication manner retaliating told especially context argument aunt like main cause taking medicine kids would scream Like scream thats gon na make anything better gon na make worse shes shes like attitude like expect give attitude give attitude Obviously Im gon na give back Im wall Im gon na let throw stuff expect retaliate Perinatally infected female Participants commonly described arguing reprimanded caregivers medical providers context perception disrespected annoyed requests take ones medication often cited reason participants refusal take medication someone really someone struggling taking meds annoying pushing away taking meds least personally Cause someone annoy someones watching every seconds make sure take meds Im gon na Ill tell Im Im going Behaviorally infected male Perinatally infected youth also described regimens heavy pill burden multiple times day dosing barriers pills take hard take day would take would make throw back tell oh cant take type medicine Give something else Perinatally infected male Many benefited recent development daily one pill daily regimens described historical barriers felt would poorly return complicated regimens like seven take like five eight pills uhh couldnt much sometimes pills thick uhh could yeah bad Yeah harder take pills made sick much better back day terrible Perinatally infected male complex regimens also taken time participants younger caregivers played larger role medication adherence Id take white ones Bactrim like like lot pills like horse pills never liked missed much Like pills going throat didnt like would take mom would like tell take like take tomorrow forget ice cream something Perinatally infected female addition complicated regimens made adherence difficult social settings participants otherwise wished keep status undisclosed take morning night would scared front friends like party one person Id feel awkward dont feel like explaining everybody Perinatally infected female Despite often easier regimens early childhood many perinatally infected youth discussed medication fatigue barrier adherence fatigue emerged physical act taking medications daily like taking much bodys getting sick need like eatin food youre tired Thats body reacts dont want long sickening disgusting matter put Cause pills pills pills like eatin like food every day whole life get aggravated get sick Perinatally infected male Others seem grow tired prospect daily lifetime medication one young man described kind hard cause every day waking taking medicine hard Sometimes dont know sometimes like sometimes feel like none stuff know Cause tiring Perinatally infected male cited fatigue andor frustration reason skipping dose nonadherent general One big issues deal wanting cause gets tiring take big cocktails Perinatally infected female many perinatally infected youth medication treatment entire lives also faced unique challenge transitioning responsibility care parents guardians perinatally infected youth transition period marked poor treatment engagement medication nonadherence always took younger age grandmother would pills pill box remind take became routine dont want take yeah take really didnt take thing thats began get like really sick spent like lot time hospital Perinatally infected female prepared responsibility yet capable willing independently manage care one young woman described parents would bring school take one time parents tried bring gym class fell pocket sooo yeah laughs kind ended yearold perinatally infected female Others tasked making decisions chose take medications engage care personally honestly dont go medical appointments get lazy depends getting ride going Perinatally infected male Barriers specific behaviorally infected youth barriers behaviorally infected youth reflected response newly diagnosed HIV stigma associated HIV transmissionrelated risk behaviors Participants described selfblame ie internalized stigma infection need emotional readiness initiate ART Among behaviorally infected youth stigma associated HIV behaviors put one risk infection manifested shame personal culpability infection One young man blamed HIV infection occurred context social isolation depression increased sexual risk behavior pretty depressed south years um going school didnt seem make connections home didnt good group friends depression kind led things werent really safe know looking attention male attention kinda took could get didnt really ask questions think thats definitely got trouble HIV Behaviorally infected male One young transgender woman ashamed diagnosis threw away first bottle pills friend discovered home recognized adherent would need prioritize treatment open medication diagnosis embarrassed take step Im place dont want take medication right Im still embarrassed ashamed Somebody come see sitting like fuck Im gon na take consistently Im gon na stay track needs front center hidden away people cant see Behaviorally infected transgender female Like young woman others also discussed delaying ART initiation emotionally ready actually refuse get meds earlier year wasnt ready Theres huge amount anxiety think theres element denial dont go get lab tests done assume youre fine wanting sort ignore ready deal medical aspect wanting feel tied doctors office Behaviorally infected transgender male delay provided opportunity address emotional psychological barriers treatment also created potential barrier initiating therapy clinically indicated recommended medical providers asked going meds first year diagnosis Tcells dropping got range resisted starting medications something started medications feeling emotionally place like next step Behaviorally infected male Discussion Common unique barriers emerged behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth reflecting varying HIV

limitations Although sample fairly diverse limited size composition Although sample large enough compare barriers mode transmission large enough compare themes across different subgroups behaviorally

majority behaviorally infected youth identified gay bisexual enough diversity sample emerge interviews whether shame personal culpability arose internalized external sources homophobia Focus groups

Open separate window Figure Conceptual framework psychosocial context adherence barriers behavior Note ART antiretroviral therapy Barriers common groups Overview Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described several common barriers medication adherence including substance use medication side effects unstructured lifestyles Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described psychosocial contexts barriers similarly instance substance use reported barrier groups use substances would increase likelihood forgetting dose Aversion experience side effects led medication avoidance groups Remembering medications difficult groups context unstructured lifestyles typical adolescence young adulthood eg balancing school work college lifestyle late night social outings etc groups also described depression mental health challenges poor risk perception consequences nonadherence medication reminder HIV privacynondisclosure HIV status psychosocial context barriers however described differently behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth Mental health groups described depressed mood common barrier described similar mechanism depressed mood could affect medication adherence example leading low motivation one want anything dont want go work dont want take medicine Behaviorally infected male groups also described depressed mood leading forgetfulness decreased attention treatment regimens One young man felt depression affected willingness stay invested treatment ART theres much emotional turbulence easier stick schedule Behaviorally infected male groups discussed ways depression led apathy fatalism one young woman described Im depressed dont want deal dont want deal HIV couldnt care less living honestly didnt mean anything take medications like die die Perinatally infected female Although experience depression effect adherence similar behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth contextual differences source mood disturbances Perinatally infected youth often described emotional disturbances within families including death parent HIV poor family interactions mother passed away HIV never fully dealt big issue aggravated foster parents aunt also living impression everyone trying take mothers place really trying deal lot things like denialism came along wanting know care remember time didnt take Perinatally infected female Behaviorally infected youth often described emotional psychosocial challenges adjusting new HIV diagnosis impact lives youre depressed wouldnt want take med thats going make depressed Like every time take med honestly feel depressed cause really forget HIV day til go take med like yeah reality check Behaviorally infected male angry HIV angry missing chunks sons life people taking care felt burdened felt like burden people take job parent um fianc working definitely depressed angry wasnt nurses handing medication supposed take wouldnt taken Behaviorally infected transgender male Risk perceptions groups poor risk perception longterm consequences nonadherence manifested inattention consequences prioritizing immediate emotions motivations taking medication Perinatally infected youth risk perceptions based prior experience nonadherence lack negative consequences short term illness rising viral load etc Ive always done really well without part reason stopped taking Im fine without physically viral load CD count would always pretty good Like guess viral load would lower something wasnt great difference Perinatally infected female also described fear death ingrained children take medication Realizing true short term bolstered justifications nonadherence mean youre young used think missed two doses row going die get older realize truth know youre going like get sick die next day Perinatally infected male Risk perceptions behaviorally infected youth typically less treatmentexperienced reflected descriptions general invincibility justifications nonadherence days getwhat call itClark Kent head think Im Superman like know dont really need Behaviorally infected male Reminder HIV ART reminder HIV status groups differences barrier behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth reflected different role HIV status played lives perinatally infected youth taking medication reminder different friends family members Many described reminder normal kind hard cause every day waking taking medicine hard know every day seeing people live normal lives want live normal life cant Perinatally infected male perinatally infected youth medication reminder always different dating back early childhood One youths description daily routine going school nurses office medications illustration point different used Gtube help take meds harder cause take meds school would go nurses office would keep medicines backpack traveling back forth Perinatally infected female behaviorally infected youth starting adhering ART reminder HIV new diagnosis many yet adjusted one young man described told needed start medication HIV status affected wasnt like accepting fact HIV Behaviorally infected male Similarly prospect taking medication also triggered negative emotions associated diagnosed HIV becoming infected One newly infected young transgender man initially avoided ART want think HIVpositive think emotional thing kind reminds every day something youd like think Behaviorally infected transgender male Nondisclosureprivacy groups participants also expressed discomfort disclosing desire privacy HIV status led delaying skipping doses others would see taking carrying medication groups tried avoid stigma associated HIV different dynamics group surrounding HIV stigma Behaviorally infected youth described HIV stigma within social networks avoiding stigma affected adherence behavior Ive fortunate people Ive made friends caring think gay community judgmental although death sentence used still big stigma Behaviorally infected male beginning pharmacy around corner mothers house transferred could get day went go pick found exs best friend pharmacist called um social worker told didnt want get switched still another problem know many people think keepin secret difficult Behaviorally infected male Perinatally infected youth described similar concerns many also described familial culture silence around HIV status prohibited disclosing status outside families discussing status among family members One young woman support mother living HIV fathers silence around HIV insistence secrecy limited sources social support adherence father didnt want people knowing status better keep hidden never really conversations HIV recently years growing never talked basically take medication dont talk Perinatally infected female Barriers specific perinatally infected youth barriers adherence unique perinatally infected youth reflected longer often lifelong experience ART barriers included reactance ie opposition authority figures complicated ART regimens fatigue chronicity HIV challenges transitions independent HIV care many perinatally infected youth taking ART point conflict caregivers medical providers Perinatally infected youth often described nonadherence means exerting control independence caregivers like take take take like OoooK like shut take someones telling take want take want shut think creates factor people thats grow become independent theyre like Fuck shit aint one going tell take going take Perinatally infected female Many described wanting told take medication would respond refusing take participants taking medication manner retaliating told especially context argument aunt like main cause taking medicine kids would scream Like scream thats gon na make anything better gon na make worse shes shes like attitude like expect give attitude give attitude Obviously Im gon na give back Im wall Im gon na let throw stuff expect retaliate Perinatally infected female Participants commonly described arguing reprimanded caregivers medical providers context perception disrespected annoyed requests take ones medication often cited reason participants refusal take medication someone really someone struggling taking meds annoying pushing away taking meds least personally Cause someone annoy someones watching every seconds make sure take meds Im gon na Ill tell Im Im going Behaviorally infected male Perinatally infected youth also described regimens heavy pill burden multiple times day dosing barriers pills take hard take day would take would make throw back tell oh cant take type medicine Give something else Perinatally infected male Many benefited recent development daily one pill daily regimens described historical barriers felt would poorly return complicated regimens like seven take like five eight pills uhh couldnt much sometimes pills thick uhh could yeah bad Yeah harder take pills made sick much better back day terrible Perinatally infected male complex regimens also taken time participants younger caregivers played larger role medication adherence Id take white ones Bactrim like like lot pills like horse pills never liked missed much Like pills going throat didnt like would take mom would like tell take like take tomorrow forget ice cream something Perinatally infected female addition complicated regimens made adherence difficult social settings participants otherwise wished keep status undisclosed take morning night would scared front friends like party one person Id feel awkward dont feel like explaining everybody Perinatally infected female Despite often easier regimens early childhood many perinatally infected youth discussed medication fatigue barrier adherence fatigue emerged physical act taking medications daily like taking much bodys getting sick need like eatin food youre tired Thats body reacts dont want long sickening disgusting matter put Cause pills pills pills like eatin like food every day whole life get aggravated get sick Perinatally infected male Others seem grow tired prospect daily lifetime medication one young man described kind hard cause every day waking taking medicine hard Sometimes dont know sometimes like sometimes feel like none stuff know Cause tiring Perinatally infected male cited fatigue andor frustration reason skipping dose nonadherent general One big issues deal wanting cause gets tiring take big cocktails Perinatally infected female many perinatally infected youth medication treatment entire lives also faced unique challenge transitioning responsibility care parents guardians perinatally infected youth transition period marked poor treatment engagement medication nonadherence always took younger age grandmother would pills pill box remind take became routine dont want take yeah take really didnt take thing thats began get like really sick spent like lot time hospital Perinatally infected female prepared responsibility yet capable willing independently manage care one young woman described parents would bring school take one time parents tried bring gym class fell pocket sooo yeah laughs kind ended yearold perinatally infected female Others tasked making decisions chose take medications engage care personally honestly dont go medical appointments get lazy depends getting ride going Perinatally infected male Barriers specific behaviorally infected youth barriers behaviorally infected youth reflected response newly diagnosed HIV stigma associated HIV transmissionrelated risk behaviors Participants described selfblame ie internalized stigma infection need emotional readiness initiate ART Among behaviorally infected youth stigma associated HIV behaviors put one risk infection manifested shame personal culpability infection One young man blamed HIV infection occurred context social isolation depression increased sexual risk behavior pretty depressed south years um going school didnt seem make connections home didnt good group friends depression kind led things werent really safe know looking attention male attention kinda took could get didnt really ask questions think thats definitely got trouble HIV Behaviorally infected male One young transgender woman ashamed diagnosis threw away first bottle pills friend discovered home recognized adherent would need prioritize treatment open medication diagnosis embarrassed take step Im place dont want take medication right Im still embarrassed ashamed Somebody come see sitting like fuck Im gon na take consistently Im gon na stay track needs front center hidden away people cant see Behaviorally infected transgender female Like young woman others also discussed delaying ART initiation emotionally ready actually refuse get meds earlier year wasnt ready Theres huge amount anxiety think theres element denial dont go get lab tests done assume youre fine wanting sort ignore ready deal medical aspect wanting feel tied doctors office Behaviorally infected transgender male delay provided opportunity address emotional psychological barriers treatment also created potential barrier initiating therapy clinically indicated recommended medical providers asked going meds first year diagnosis Tcells dropping got range resisted starting medications something started medications feeling emotionally place like next step Behaviorally infected male Discussion Common unique barriers

adherence including substance use medication side effects unstructured lifestyles Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described psychosocial contexts barriers similarly instance substance use reported barrier groups use substances would increase likelihood forgetting dose Aversion experience side effects led medication avoidance groups Remembering medications difficult groups context unstructured lifestyles typical adolescence young adulthood eg balancing school work college lifestyle late night social outings etc groups also described depression mental health challenges poor risk perception consequences nonadherence medication reminder HIV privacynondisclosure HIV status psychosocial context barriers however described differently behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth Mental health groups described depressed mood common barrier described similar mechanism depressed mood could affect medication adherence example leading low motivation one want anything dont want go work dont want take medicine Behaviorally infected male groups also described depressed mood leading forgetfulness decreased attention treatment regimens One young man felt depression affected willingness stay invested treatment ART theres much emotional turbulence easier stick schedule Behaviorally infected male groups discussed ways depression led apathy fatalism one young woman described Im depressed dont want deal dont want deal HIV couldnt care less living honestly didnt mean anything take medications like die die Perinatally infected female Although experience depression effect adherence similar behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth contextual differences source mood disturbances Perinatally infected youth often described emotional disturbances within families including death parent HIV poor family interactions mother passed away HIV never fully dealt big issue aggravated foster parents aunt also living impression everyone trying take mothers place really trying deal lot things like denialism came along wanting know care remember time didnt take Perinatally infected female Behaviorally infected youth often described emotional psychosocial challenges adjusting new HIV diagnosis impact lives youre depressed wouldnt want take med thats going make depressed Like every time take med honestly feel depressed cause really forget HIV day til go take med like yeah reality check Behaviorally infected male angry HIV angry missing chunks sons life people taking care felt burdened felt like burden people take job parent um fianc working definitely depressed angry wasnt nurses handing medication supposed take wouldnt taken Behaviorally infected transgender male Risk perceptions groups poor risk perception longterm consequences nonadherence manifested inattention consequences prioritizing immediate emotions motivations taking medication Perinatally infected youth risk perceptions based prior experience nonadherence lack negative consequences short term illness rising viral load etc Ive always done really well without part reason stopped taking Im fine without physically viral load CD count would always pretty good Like guess viral load would lower something wasnt great difference Perinatally infected female also described fear death ingrained children take medication Realizing true short term bolstered justifications nonadherence mean youre young used think missed two doses row going die get older realize truth know youre going like get sick die next day Perinatally infected male Risk perceptions behaviorally infected youth typically less treatmentexperienced reflected descriptions general invincibility justifications nonadherence days getwhat call itClark Kent head think Im Superman like know dont really need Behaviorally infected male Reminder HIV ART reminder HIV status groups differences barrier behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth reflected different role HIV status played lives perinatally infected youth taking medication reminder different friends family members Many described reminder normal kind hard cause every day waking taking medicine hard know every day seeing people live normal lives want live normal life cant Perinatally infected male perinatally infected youth medication reminder always different dating back early childhood One youths description daily routine going school nurses office medications illustration point different used Gtube help take meds harder cause take meds school would go nurses office would keep medicines backpack traveling back forth Perinatally infected female behaviorally infected youth starting adhering ART reminder HIV new diagnosis many yet adjusted one young man described told needed start medication HIV status affected wasnt like accepting fact HIV Behaviorally infected male Similarly prospect taking medication also triggered negative emotions associated diagnosed HIV becoming infected One newly infected young transgender man initially avoided ART want think HIVpositive think emotional thing kind reminds every day something youd like think Behaviorally infected transgender male Nondisclosureprivacy groups participants also expressed discomfort disclosing desire privacy HIV status led delaying skipping doses others would see taking carrying medication groups tried avoid stigma associated HIV different dynamics group surrounding HIV stigma Behaviorally infected youth described HIV stigma within social networks avoiding stigma affected adherence behavior Ive fortunate people Ive made friends caring think gay community judgmental although death sentence used still big stigma Behaviorally infected male beginning pharmacy around corner mothers house transferred could get day went go pick found exs best friend pharmacist called um social worker told didnt want get switched still another problem know many people think keepin secret difficult Behaviorally infected male Perinatally infected youth described similar concerns many also described familial culture silence around HIV status prohibited disclosing status outside families discussing status among family members One young woman support mother living HIV fathers silence around HIV insistence secrecy limited sources social support adherence father didnt want people knowing status better keep hidden never really conversations HIV recently years growing never talked basically take medication dont talk Perinatally infected female Barriers specific perinatally infected youth barriers adherence unique perinatally infected youth reflected longer often lifelong experience ART barriers included reactance ie opposition authority figures complicated ART regimens fatigue chronicity HIV challenges transitions independent HIV care many perinatally infected youth taking ART point conflict caregivers medical providers Perinatally infected youth often described nonadherence means exerting control independence caregivers like take take take like OoooK like shut take someones telling take want take want shut think creates factor people thats grow become independent theyre like Fuck shit aint one going tell take going take Perinatally infected female Many described wanting told take medication would respond refusing take participants taking medication manner retaliating told especially context argument aunt like main cause taking medicine kids would scream Like scream thats gon na make anything better gon na make worse shes shes like attitude like expect give attitude give attitude Obviously Im gon na give back Im wall Im gon na let throw stuff expect retaliate Perinatally infected female Participants commonly described arguing reprimanded caregivers medical providers context perception disrespected annoyed requests take ones medication often cited reason participants refusal take medication someone really someone struggling taking meds annoying pushing away taking meds least personally Cause someone annoy someones watching every seconds make sure take meds Im gon na Ill tell Im Im going Behaviorally infected male Perinatally infected youth also described regimens heavy pill burden multiple times day dosing barriers pills take hard take day would take would make throw back tell oh cant take type medicine Give something else Perinatally infected male Many benefited recent development daily one pill daily regimens described historical barriers felt would poorly return complicated regimens like seven take like five eight pills uhh couldnt much sometimes pills thick uhh could yeah bad Yeah harder take pills made sick much better back day terrible Perinatally infected male complex regimens also taken time participants younger caregivers played larger role medication adherence Id take white ones Bactrim like like lot pills like horse pills never liked missed much Like pills going throat didnt like would take mom would like tell take like take tomorrow forget ice cream something Perinatally infected female addition complicated regimens made adherence difficult social settings participants otherwise wished keep status undisclosed take morning night would scared front friends like party one person Id feel awkward dont feel like explaining everybody Perinatally infected female Despite often easier regimens early childhood many perinatally infected youth discussed medication fatigue barrier adherence fatigue emerged physical act taking medications daily like taking much bodys getting sick need like eatin food youre tired Thats body reacts dont want long sickening disgusting matter put Cause pills pills pills like eatin like food every day whole life get aggravated get sick Perinatally infected male Others seem grow tired prospect daily lifetime medication one young man described kind hard cause every day waking taking medicine hard Sometimes dont know sometimes like sometimes feel like none stuff know Cause tiring Perinatally infected male cited fatigue andor frustration reason skipping dose nonadherent general One big issues deal wanting cause gets tiring take big cocktails Perinatally infected female many perinatally infected youth medication treatment entire lives also faced unique challenge transitioning responsibility care parents guardians perinatally infected youth transition period marked poor treatment engagement medication nonadherence always took younger age grandmother would pills pill box remind take became routine dont want take yeah take really didnt take thing thats began get like really sick spent like lot time hospital Perinatally infected female prepared responsibility yet capable willing independently manage care one young woman described parents would bring school take one time parents tried bring gym class fell pocket sooo yeah laughs kind ended yearold perinatally infected female Others tasked making decisions chose take medications engage care personally honestly dont go medical appointments get lazy depends getting ride going Perinatally infected male Barriers specific behaviorally infected youth barriers behaviorally infected youth reflected response newly diagnosed HIV stigma associated HIV transmissionrelated risk behaviors Participants described selfblame ie internalized stigma infection need emotional readiness initiate ART Among behaviorally infected youth stigma associated HIV behaviors put one risk infection manifested shame personal culpability infection One young man blamed HIV infection occurred context social isolation depression increased sexual risk behavior pretty depressed south years um going school didnt seem make connections home didnt good group friends depression kind led things werent really safe know looking attention male attention kinda took could get

initiation emotionally ready actually refuse get meds earlier year wasnt ready Theres huge amount anxiety think theres element denial dont go get lab tests done assume youre fine wanting sort ignore ready deal medical aspect wanting feel tied doctors office Behaviorally infected transgender male delay provided opportunity address emotional psychological barriers treatment also created potential barrier initiating therapy clinically indicated recommended medical providers asked going meds first year diagnosis Tcells dropping got range resisted starting medications something started medications feeling emotionally place like next step Behaviorally infected male Discussion Common unique barriers emerged behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth reflecting varying HIV

Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described several common barriers medication adherence including substance use medication side effects unstructured lifestyles Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described psychosocial contexts barriers similarly instance substance use reported barrier groups use substances would increase likelihood forgetting dose Aversion experience side effects led medication avoidance groups Remembering medications difficult groups context unstructured lifestyles typical adolescence young adulthood eg balancing school work college lifestyle late night social outings etc groups also described depression mental health challenges poor risk perception consequences nonadherence medication reminder HIV privacynondisclosure HIV status psychosocial context barriers however described differently behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth Mental health groups described depressed mood common barrier described similar mechanism depressed mood could affect medication adherence example leading low motivation one want anything dont want go work dont want take medicine Behaviorally infected male groups also described depressed mood leading forgetfulness decreased attention treatment regimens One young man felt depression affected willingness stay invested treatment ART theres much emotional turbulence easier stick schedule Behaviorally infected male groups discussed ways depression led apathy fatalism one young woman described Im depressed dont want deal dont want deal HIV couldnt care less living honestly didnt mean anything take medications like die die Perinatally infected female Although experience depression effect adherence similar behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth contextual differences source mood disturbances Perinatally infected youth often described emotional disturbances within families including death parent HIV poor family interactions mother passed away HIV never fully dealt big issue aggravated foster parents aunt also living impression everyone trying take mothers place really trying deal lot things like denialism came along wanting know care remember time didnt take Perinatally infected female Behaviorally infected youth often described emotional psychosocial challenges adjusting new HIV diagnosis impact lives youre depressed wouldnt want take med thats going

people taking care felt burdened felt like burden people take job parent um fianc working definitely depressed angry wasnt nurses handing medication supposed take wouldnt taken Behaviorally infected transgender male Risk perceptions groups poor risk perception longterm consequences nonadherence manifested inattention consequences prioritizing immediate emotions motivations taking medication Perinatally infected youth risk perceptions based prior experience nonadherence lack negative consequences short term illness rising viral load etc Ive always done really well without part reason stopped taking Im fine without physically viral load CD count would always pretty good Like guess viral load would lower something wasnt great difference Perinatally infected female also described fear death ingrained children take medication Realizing true short term bolstered justifications nonadherence mean youre young used think missed two doses row going die get older realize truth know youre going like get sick die next day Perinatally infected male Risk perceptions behaviorally infected youth typically less treatmentexperienced reflected descriptions general invincibility justifications nonadherence days getwhat call itClark Kent head think Im Superman like know dont really need Behaviorally infected male Reminder HIV ART reminder HIV status groups differences barrier behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth reflected different role HIV status played lives perinatally infected youth taking medication reminder different friends family members Many described

medication reminder always different dating back early childhood One youths description daily routine going school nurses office medications illustration point different used Gtube help take meds harder cause take meds school would go nurses office would keep medicines backpack traveling back forth Perinatally infected female behaviorally infected youth starting adhering ART reminder HIV new diagnosis many yet adjusted one young man described told needed start medication HIV status affected wasnt like accepting fact HIV Behaviorally infected male Similarly prospect taking medication also triggered negative emotions associated diagnosed HIV becoming infected One newly infected young transgender man initially avoided ART want think HIVpositive think emotional thing kind reminds every day something youd like think Behaviorally infected transgender male Nondisclosureprivacy groups participants also expressed discomfort disclosing desire privacy HIV status led delaying skipping doses others would see taking carrying medication groups tried avoid stigma associated HIV different dynamics group surrounding HIV stigma Behaviorally infected youth described HIV stigma within social

male beginning pharmacy around corner mothers house transferred could get day went go pick found exs best friend pharmacist called um social worker told didnt want get switched still another problem know many people think keepin secret difficult Behaviorally infected male Perinatally infected youth described similar concerns many also described familial culture silence around HIV status prohibited disclosing status outside families discussing status among family members One young woman support mother living HIV fathers silence around HIV insistence secrecy limited sources social support adherence father didnt want people knowing status better keep hidden never really conversations HIV recently years growing never talked basically take medication dont talk Perinatally infected female Barriers specific perinatally infected youth barriers adherence unique perinatally infected youth reflected longer often lifelong experience ART barriers included reactance ie opposition authority figures complicated ART regimens fatigue chronicity HIV challenges transitions independent HIV care many perinatally infected youth taking ART point conflict caregivers medical providers Perinatally infected youth often described nonadherence means exerting control independence caregivers like take take take like OoooK like shut take someones telling take want take want shut think creates factor people thats grow become independent theyre like Fuck shit aint one going tell take going take Perinatally infected female Many described wanting told take medication would respond refusing take participants taking medication manner retaliating told especially context argument aunt like main cause taking medicine kids would scream Like scream thats gon na make anything better gon na make worse shes shes like attitude like expect give attitude give attitude Obviously Im gon na give back Im wall Im gon na let throw stuff expect retaliate Perinatally infected female

medication someone really someone struggling taking meds annoying pushing away taking meds least personally Cause someone annoy someones watching every seconds make sure take meds Im gon na Ill tell Im Im going Behaviorally infected male Perinatally infected youth also described regimens heavy pill burden multiple times day dosing barriers pills take hard take day would take would make throw back tell oh cant take type medicine Give something else Perinatally infected male Many benefited recent development daily one pill daily regimens described historical barriers felt would poorly return complicated regimens like seven take like five eight pills uhh couldnt much sometimes pills thick uhh could yeah bad Yeah harder take pills made sick much better back day terrible Perinatally infected male complex regimens also taken time participants younger caregivers played larger role medication adherence Id take white ones Bactrim like like lot pills like horse pills never liked missed much Like pills going throat didnt like would take mom would like tell take like take tomorrow forget ice cream something Perinatally infected female addition complicated regimens made adherence difficult social settings participants otherwise wished keep status undisclosed take morning night would scared front friends like party one person Id feel awkward dont feel like explaining everybody Perinatally infected female Despite often easier regimens early childhood many perinatally infected youth discussed medication fatigue barrier adherence fatigue emerged physical act taking medications daily like taking much bodys getting sick need like eatin food youre tired Thats body reacts dont want long sickening disgusting matter put Cause pills pills pills like eatin like food every day whole

lived experience HIV differed substantially mode transmission core category central theme emerged data individual adherence behavior affected multiple levels influence psychosocial context participants lived experience HIV meso micro levels influence eg family dynamics HIV stigma adolescent transitions development intrapersonal level barriers resulting influence psychosocial context developed theoretical framework based findings derived social ecological framework see Figure Bronfenbrenner Psychosocial context varied perinatally behaviorally infected youth nature different experiences HIV even common barriers adherence different antecedents used barriers common groups Figure examples illustrate distinct psychosocial contexts influencing barriers across groups example nondisclosure HIV status described adherence barrier groups however behaviorally infected youth psychosocial contextual antecedent barrier HIV stigma within social networks Among perinatally infected youth nondisclosure influenced culture HIV silence within families Open separate window Figure Conceptual framework psychosocial context adherence barriers behavior Note ART antiretroviral therapy Barriers common groups Overview Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described several common barriers medication adherence including substance use medication side effects unstructured lifestyles Behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth described psychosocial contexts barriers similarly instance substance use reported barrier groups use substances would increase likelihood forgetting dose Aversion experience side effects led medication avoidance groups Remembering medications difficult groups context unstructured lifestyles typical adolescence young adulthood eg balancing school work college lifestyle late night social outings etc groups also described depression mental health challenges poor risk perception consequences nonadherence medication reminder HIV privacynondisclosure HIV status psychosocial context barriers however described differently behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth Mental health groups described depressed mood common barrier described similar mechanism depressed mood could affect medication adherence example leading low motivation one want anything dont want go work dont want take medicine Behaviorally infected male groups also described depressed mood leading forgetfulness decreased attention treatment regimens One young man felt depression affected willingness stay invested treatment ART theres much emotional turbulence easier stick schedule Behaviorally infected male groups discussed ways depression led apathy fatalism one young woman described Im depressed dont want deal dont want deal HIV couldnt care less living honestly didnt mean anything take medications like die die Perinatally infected female Although experience depression effect adherence similar behaviorally infected perinatally infected youth contextual differences source mood disturbances Perinatally infected youth often described emotional disturbances within families including death parent HIV poor family

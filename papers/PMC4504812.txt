experience discomfort seeing body avoiding exposure shape feel fat Although partially explained tendency discount delayed rewards full partial mediation delay discounting effect neuroticism engagement disordered eating demonstrates importance delay discounting understanding manifestation disordered eating among adolescents emerging adults important note delay discounting account variance effects neuroticism engagement disordered eating Significant direct effects neuroticism engagement disordered eating indicates importance neuroticism construct impacting engagement disordered eating even without delay discounting Direct indirect pathways neurotic personality engagement disordered eating reveal different pathways effects Emotional reactivity related neurotic personality may effects neurobehaivoral functioning Neuroticism may alter disrupt executive functioning processes thereby increasing vulnerability engagement disordered eating especially via depressed mood coping mechanism decrease anxiousness Moreover neuroticism associated eating restraint adolescent exhibited restraint eating avoided eating food strict dietary rules often functioned empty stomach Since highly neurotic individuals often characterized high anxiety excessive worrying perfectionism likely concerned appear others consistent finding within concern domain ie eating concern shape concern weight concern Thus neurotic adolescents may seem aware appear rather actually engaging overt unhealthy eating habits may negatively impact perceived example functioning empty stomach perceived avoiding food easily perceived interpreted negatively others Limitations present study several limitations First data collection restricted selfreport data result respondents may underreport behaviors viewed undesirable society neurotic characteristics disordered eating patterns although complex model factors involved adolescents vulnerability engagement disordered eating present study focused demonstrating association neuroticism impulsivity regard disordered eating study also crosssectional therefore prove causality shed light structural relationships variables Therefore complex model risk factors multiple time points ie adolescence transition emerging adulthood desired Also due small sample size enough power conduct separate analyses gender Since females appear engaging disordered

neuroticism engagement disordered eating demonstrates importance delay discounting understanding manifestation disordered eating among adolescents emerging adults important note delay discounting account variance effects neuroticism engagement disordered eating Significant direct effects neuroticism engagement disordered eating indicates importance neuroticism construct impacting engagement disordered eating even without delay discounting Direct indirect pathways neurotic personality engagement disordered eating reveal different pathways effects Emotional reactivity related neurotic personality may effects neurobehaivoral functioning Neuroticism may alter disrupt executive functioning processes thereby increasing vulnerability engagement disordered eating especially via depressed mood coping mechanism decrease anxiousness Moreover neuroticism associated eating restraint adolescent exhibited restraint eating avoided eating food strict dietary rules often functioned empty stomach Since highly neurotic individuals often characterized high anxiety excessive worrying perfectionism likely concerned appear others consistent finding within concern domain ie eating concern shape concern weight concern Thus neurotic adolescents may seem aware appear rather actually engaging overt unhealthy eating habits may negatively impact perceived example functioning empty stomach perceived avoiding food easily perceived interpreted negatively others Limitations present study several limitations First data collection restricted selfreport data result respondents may underreport

predicting engagement disordered eating adolescents separate contributions neuroticism disordered eating previously examined However mediation model whether impulsivity mediates relationship neuroticism engagement disordered eating examined Thus first study date determine whether impulsivity mediates relationship neuroticism engagement disordered eating Neuroticism significantly associated disinhibition inattention believed strong emotional reactivity displayed individuals may interfere executive functioning processes Hirsh Morisano Peterson Given neurotic individuals tendency strive perfectionism tasks inhibitory control attention may effortful engaged behavioral tasks one would assume would contribute better performance compared low moderate neurotic individuals However disruption executive functioning may undermine performance goals thereby resulting overall performance similar worse low neuroticism Delay discounting found fully mediate relationship neuroticism eating concern Meaning delay discounting entirely explained relationship neuroticism eating concern Neurotic adolescents likely preoccupation food fear losing control eating tendency eat secret partake social eating guilt eating relationship wholly explained decision making Meaning neurotic adolescents discount delayed rewards healthy weight loss weight maintenance immediate gratification eating secret eating unhealthy foods Delay discounting partially mediated relationship neuroticism weight concern neuroticism shape concern Partial mediation refers case path independent

experience discomfort seeing body avoiding exposure shape feel fat Although partially explained tendency discount delayed rewards full partial mediation delay discounting effect neuroticism engagement disordered eating demonstrates importance delay discounting understanding manifestation disordered eating among adolescents emerging adults important note delay discounting account variance effects neuroticism engagement disordered eating Significant direct effects neuroticism engagement disordered eating indicates importance neuroticism construct impacting engagement disordered eating even without delay discounting Direct indirect pathways neurotic personality engagement disordered eating reveal different pathways effects Emotional reactivity related neurotic personality may effects neurobehaivoral functioning Neuroticism may alter disrupt executive functioning processes thereby increasing vulnerability engagement disordered eating especially via depressed mood coping mechanism decrease anxiousness Moreover neuroticism associated eating restraint adolescent exhibited restraint eating avoided eating food strict dietary rules often functioned empty stomach Since highly neurotic individuals often characterized high anxiety excessive worrying perfectionism likely concerned appear others consistent finding within concern domain ie eating concern shape concern weight concern Thus neurotic adolescents may seem aware appear rather actually engaging overt unhealthy eating habits may negatively impact perceived example functioning empty stomach perceived avoiding food easily perceived interpreted negatively others Limitations present study several limitations First data collection restricted selfreport data result respondents may underreport behaviors viewed undesirable society neurotic characteristics disordered eating patterns although complex model factors involved adolescents vulnerability engagement disordered eating present study focused demonstrating association neuroticism impulsivity regard disordered eating study also crosssectional therefore prove causality shed light structural relationships variables Therefore complex model risk factors multiple time points ie adolescence transition emerging adulthood desired Also due small sample size enough power conduct separate analyses gender Since females appear engaging disordered eating higher rates examination gender needed Finally participants present study representative adolescents sample limited ethnic diversity included adolescents emerging adults school Since school believed protective factor poor health outcomes findings believed underestimate healthrisk consequences Bernard Marshall Rutman Park Castor Tauali Forquera Conclusion goal present study help better understand relationship neuroticism impulsivity engagement disordered eating hopes advancing prevention treatment programs maladaptive eating patterns youth High levels neuroticism significantly associated disordered eating indicating neurotic personality renders adolescents susceptible developing various patterns skewed perceptions eating weight shape concerns However neuroticism related eating restriction indicating preoccupation appearance necessarily manifestation certain forms maladaptive eating behavior present analysis supported previous findings highly neurotic individuals prefer shortterm gains longterm rewards several eating disorder domain subtypes delay discounting fully partially mediated relationship neuroticism patterns disordered eating Results indicate neuroticism impulsivity specifically delay discounting may play important role adolescent engagement disordered eating understanding mechanisms underlie disordered eating developmental period would benefit greatly increased research role personality traits delay discounting Highlights Neuroticism associated delay discounting However neuroticism associated disinhibition inattention Delay

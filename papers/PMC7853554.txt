householdlevel isolation practices could effective preventing transmission Findings SARSCoV epidemic showed isolation patient peak shedding effective reducing household transmission results suggest adopting precautionary measures effective preventing secondary household transmission households transmission experienced providing index patient separate sleeping quarters avoiding facetoface interactions eg shared mealtimes appeared sufficient prevent transmission even households close intimate contact occurred diagnosis findings show however persons infected SARSCoV could begin shedding virus prompted isolate onset symptoms contrast households transmission consisted primarily adults households secondary transmission contacts consisted parents adolescent preadolescent children households childcare needs difficulties maintaining full isolation caused members eschew precautionary practices particularly household members known infectedOur study limitations First household caseseries small intensive nature early monitoring protocol also biased toward index patients sufficiently symptomatic tested whose disease severe enough require hospitalization Second although SARSCoVpositive contacts symptom onset days estimated minimum incubation period corresponding index patient rule possibility transmission presymptomatic household contact another contact Finally symptom data relied selfreporting symptoms might present reported patients Three household contacts children years age might difficulty recognizing reporting symptoms Patient subjectivity could contribute whether virus shedding symptom onset observed firstIn conclusion findings indicate shedding SARSCoV virus might occur early disease course symptom onset clinical diagnosis could occur symptoms mild even absent Persons confirmed COVID close contact someone confirmed COVID limit close contact others including household members days Persons exposed SARSCoV vigilant onset mild symptoms already limited close contact household members persons onset even mild symptoms prompt additional caution efforts limit close contact addition wearing masks cloth face covers practicing hand hygiene disinfecting surfaces regularly might reduce risk transmission households Stayathome orders athome selftreatment COVID United States requires clear communication guidelines prevent household

enormously among species Wright Andolfatto Gossmann et al Galtier despite substantial theory empirical data primary causes variation remain uncertain Galtier Rousselle et al first approximation rate

nonadaptive aminoacid substitutions relative reduction nonsynonymous pairwise diversity shown significantly correlated N e estimated synonymous diversity Galtier Chen et al Two explanations lack

Williamson et al MKlike tests applied noncoding genomic regions forms adaptive evolutionsuch mediated adaptive gene duplications Despite potential shortcomings estimates adaptive fixation rates derived MK framework reflect underlying biology eg Huber et al example theory predicts selective interference among linked loci impede adaptive fixation Hill Robertson Charlesworth MK framework

adaptive fixation also vary genomic context level pattern gene expression genes X Z chromosomes often show higher rates adaptive evolution autosomal genes reviewed Meisel Connallon Finally perhaps compellingly precisely proteincoding genes expect display high rates adaptive fixation priori genes potentially engaged resistance parasites pathogens give highest estimated rates eg Haerty et al

nontargeted PEG liposomes melanoma cells Figure Section Figure Figure Potential DOX delivery vivo however quite different vitro one considers circulation times Unlike DOX encapsulated within PEGylated liposomes free DOX rapidly cleared circulation therefore exposure tumor cells limited fact previously reported free DOX cleared times faster DOX encapsulated within PEGylated liposomes Furthermore extravasated PEGylated liposomes experience enhanced retention within tumor site attributed lack functional lymphatic drainage tumors BF mouse melanoma model DOX incorporated within nontargeted liposomes showed little effect reducing tumor size targeted liposomes significantly reduced tumor size Figure improved activity due selective uptake targeted liposomes CDexpressing cells rather DOX

triplehelical nature ligand renders reasonably stable proteolysis especially compared targeting molecules nanoDDS also incorporate PEG improve circulation time minimally compromising cytotoxic activity principle multitargeting achieved straightforward incorporation additional PA ligands Multitargeting may especially advantageous imaging andor therapy cancer stem cells targeting one cell

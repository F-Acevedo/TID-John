generally lacking area results consistent recent paper found high fructose diet led increased skeletal density increased length adolescent rats research needed examining effects fructose early life including low doses order draw causative conclusions specific impact fructose infant adiposity tissue development Since human milk naturally contain fructose findings highlight maternal intake fructosecontaining products sugar sweetened beverages targetable intervention reducing exposure fructose early life previous studies shown fructose transmitted utero placenta findings extend literature identifying breast milk potential route fructose transmission postnatal period Assuming mL daily intake breast milk concentration observed sample would represent approximately mgday fructose consumptionan amount roughly equal mg per kg body weight onemonth old infant recognize amount fructose low far outside range fructose currently known physiological effects Although small concentration could meaningful effects developing infants example fructose may obesogenic low concentrations infants increased susceptibility chemicals environment including delivered indirectly

effects infant metabolism addition possible low levels fructose reported indicating basal levels higher levels fructose might delivered via breast milk infant mother consuming sugars time feeding also possible detected fructose levels serving proxy measure factor affecting infant growth studies needed examine pharmacokinetics fructose transmission breast milk response maternal consumption Unfortunately dietary data collected part study thus possible formally determine whether mothers habitual consumption fructose positively associated level fructose detected breast milk Future studies examining relationship maternal diet breast milk sugar concentrations important informing guidelines monitoring sugar fructose intake lactation period determining Western diet typically affects breast milk composition infant growth Previous studies shown higher breast milk glucose concentrations associated greater adiposity infants current study breast milk glucose levels related infant measures adiposity possible discrepancy may explained different study designs interactions maternal factors present cohort ie gestational diabetes Ultimately studies needed determine whether effects breast milk sugars robust replicable across variety infant cohorts future studies consider potential effects fructose glucose breast milk Limitations present study include small sample size proofofconcept study limited length followup six months age lack dietary intake data could help explain relationship fructose breast milk sugar composition Although women instructed exclusively breastfeed possible food introduction may occurred infants study period contributed growth body composition particularly infants given access fructosecontaining food products Indeed recent study evaluated sugar content commercial infant toddler food products found snacks desserts juicesdrinks targeted infants contain least one added sugar high fructose corn syrup present items Many items contain sugars amounts differ nutrition labels often excess recommended daily levels Together findings indicate highly likely infants exposed fructose first months life eg breastfeeding andor weaning complementary foods introduced diet highlighting need research effects sugars child development Another potential limitation limited metabolic variables mothers Although exclude mothers type diabetes based standard clinical criteria unable assess prediabetes sample Therefore may possible mothers prediabetes increased levels insulin sugars breast milk However breast milk levels insulin glucose associated infant growth body composition Conclusions Overall study suggests novel mechanism infants may inadvertently exposed fructose breast milk sugar sweetened beverages fructosecontaining foods introduced infant diet work also opens door interventions aimed towards decreased consumption added sugars lactating Future work performed larger samples longer followup months order establish whether relationships

milk composition infant growth Previous studies shown higher breast milk glucose concentrations associated greater adiposity infants current study breast milk glucose levels related infant measures adiposity possible discrepancy may explained different study designs interactions maternal factors present cohort ie gestational diabetes Ultimately studies needed determine whether effects breast milk sugars robust replicable across variety infant cohorts future studies consider potential effects fructose glucose breast milk Limitations present study include small sample size proofofconcept study limited length followup six months age lack dietary intake data could help explain relationship fructose breast milk sugar composition Although women instructed exclusively breastfeed possible food introduction may occurred infants study period contributed growth body composition particularly infants given access fructosecontaining food products Indeed recent study evaluated sugar content commercial infant toddler food products found snacks desserts juicesdrinks targeted infants contain least one added sugar high fructose corn syrup present items Many items contain sugars amounts differ nutrition labels often excess recommended daily levels Together findings indicate highly likely infants exposed fructose first months life eg breastfeeding andor weaning complementary foods introduced diet highlighting need research effects sugars child development Another potential limitation limited metabolic variables mothers Although exclude mothers type diabetes based standard clinical criteria unable assess prediabetes sample Therefore may possible mothers prediabetes increased levels insulin sugars breast milk However breast milk levels insulin glucose associated infant growth body composition Conclusions Overall study suggests novel mechanism infants may inadvertently exposed fructose breast milk sugar sweetened beverages fructosecontaining foods introduced infant diet work also opens door interventions aimed towards decreased consumption added sugars lactating Future work performed larger samples longer followup months order establish whether relationships

fructosecontaining products sugar sweetened beverages targetable intervention reducing exposure fructose early life previous studies shown fructose transmitted utero placenta findings extend literature identifying breast milk potential route fructose transmission postnatal period Assuming mL daily intake breast milk concentration observed sample would represent approximately mgday fructose consumptionan amount roughly equal mg per kg body weight onemonth old infant recognize amount fructose low far outside range fructose currently known physiological effects Although small

possible detected fructose levels serving proxy measure factor affecting infant growth studies needed examine pharmacokinetics fructose transmission breast milk response maternal consumption Unfortunately dietary data collected part study thus possible formally determine whether mothers habitual consumption fructose positively associated level fructose detected breast milk Future studies examining relationship maternal diet breast milk sugar concentrations important informing guidelines monitoring sugar fructose intake lactation period determining Western diet typically affects breast

adiposity possible discrepancy may explained different study designs interactions maternal factors present cohort ie gestational diabetes Ultimately studies needed determine whether effects breast milk sugars robust replicable across variety infant cohorts future studies consider potential effects fructose glucose breast milk Limitations present study include small sample size proofofconcept study limited length followup six months age lack dietary intake data could help explain relationship fructose breast milk sugar composition Although women instructed exclusively breastfeed possible food introduction may occurred infants study period contributed growth body composition particularly infants given access fructosecontaining food products Indeed recent study evaluated sugar content commercial infant toddler food products found snacks desserts juicesdrinks targeted infants contain least one added sugar high fructose corn syrup present items Many items contain sugars amounts differ nutrition labels often excess recommended daily levels Together findings indicate highly likely infants exposed fructose first months life eg breastfeeding andor weaning complementary foods introduced diet highlighting need research effects sugars child development Another potential limitation limited metabolic variables mothers Although exclude mothers type diabetes based standard clinical criteria unable assess prediabetes sample Therefore may possible mothers prediabetes increased levels insulin sugars breast milk However breast milk levels insulin glucose associated infant growth body composition Conclusions Overall study suggests novel mechanism infants may inadvertently exposed fructose breast milk sugar sweetened beverages fructosecontaining foods introduced infant diet work also opens door interventions aimed towards decreased consumption added sugars lactating Future work performed larger samples longer followup months order establish whether relationships

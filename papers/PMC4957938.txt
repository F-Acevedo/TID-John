adjuvant mitotane observed studies given sideeffect profile mitotane brings question value therapy delays recurrence ultimately prolong life validity generalizability Terzolo study also questioned

highvolume oncologic referral center recurrence rate majority receive adjuvant mitotane therapy Similarly current study conducted US academic centers recurrence rate high recurrence rates Terzolo study could suggest inadequate surgery control groups thereby confounding results current data adjuvant mitotane conflicting potential benefits therapy must weighed risks Mitotane associated severe

mitotane levels mgL subtherapeutic Mitotane levels available entire patient population spans decades levels reported mgL Notably studies cautioned interpretation level misleading serum level fluctuates greatly depending timing blood draw predicting blood level based dosage complex Additionally many European studies used proposed European Network Study Adrenal Tumors staging analyses rather American Joint Committee Cancer staging SEER study previously shown European Network Study Adrenal Tumors staging better discriminates stage II III patients current study used American Joint Committee Cancer staging criteria also stratified patients N stage attempting account potential bias introduced choice staging system Recent literature suggested increased Ki represents important marker risk recurrence patients resection ACC Ki routinely tested patient population current study study institutions spanning years feasible attain data study span year period would question

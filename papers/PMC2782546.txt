MMP inhibition resveratrol observed suggests HUVEC behaviors described MMP dependent illustrates limitation usage compounds metalloproteinase inhibitors present form binding linked variety cellular events however detract development piceatannol pyrogallol derivatives metzincin inhibitors Alternatively obtaining small molecule metalloproteinase inhibitor pyrogallol presents several future options Pyrogallol represents unique probe traditional medicinal chemistry efforts could modified create inhibitor higher affinity Alternatively pyrogallol could used fragmentbased approach assembly novel inhibitory compounds fragmentbased approaches substantial prior recent successes metalloproteinase inhibitor development Interestingly piceatannol compound reasonably effective aggrecanase MMP inhibitor resveratrol compound differs one hydroxyl group one assumes entire molecule involved binding interaction would surprising Since conclusion make based data herein compound binds ADAMTS competitive manner one plausible answer phenolic rings critical binding Rather one may important binding region conserved piceatannol resveratrol region conserved molecules might involved ADAMTS interaction Alternatively one could propose two vicinal hydroxyls present piceatannol utilized Zn binding group single hydroxyl present resveratrol produces inadequate Zn binding However review known Zn binding groups suggests efficient Zn binding mediated thioalcohol hydroxyls binding mode thiol known monodentate thioalcohol binding mode unknown Thus hydroxyl may participate appreciably Zn binding Another interesting observation pyrogallol compound determined effective inhibitor aggrecanases whereas pyrocatechol compound differing one hydroxyl Since data support pyrogallol exosite binding inhibitor data exists determine binds enzyme would difficult speculate difference exists possible hydroxyl modified pyrocatechol bind ADAMTS albeit weaker hydroxyl modified pyrogallol noted limiting factor aggrecanase analysis relatively slow rate hydrolysis reaction rate must measured time frame hours rather minutes necessary MMP analysis Thus analysis pyrocatechol binding affinity

inhibition MMP exosite inhibitor based use triple helical singlestranded substrates Alternatively apparent differences binding affinity could artifact due inflation IC K use substrate concentrations nearing surpassing K substrate concentration important consideration optimizing experimental design differences herein likely artifactual enzyme substrate concentrations fixed K determination Thus overestimation K value compound would mirrored compound Since K value determined different substrates ADAMTS compound appreciably different K values compound fold higher shorter substrate differences unlikely linked experimental parameters Table MMPs K values shorter substrates generally higher longer substrates thus possible K values determined longer substrate fMMPS long could overestimated case aggrecanases K values short long substrates approximately equal therefore overestimation K values consistent cases search unique exosite binding inhibitors could proceed rapid fashion screening

development piceatannol pyrogallol derivatives metzincin inhibitors Alternatively obtaining small molecule metalloproteinase inhibitor pyrogallol presents several future options Pyrogallol represents

fragmentbased approaches substantial prior recent successes metalloproteinase inhibitor development Interestingly piceatannol compound reasonably effective aggrecanase MMP inhibitor resveratrol compound differs one hydroxyl group one assumes entire molecule involved binding interaction would surprising Since conclusion make based data herein compound binds ADAMTS competitive manner one plausible answer phenolic rings critical binding Rather one may important binding region conserved piceatannol resveratrol region conserved molecules might involved ADAMTS interaction Alternatively

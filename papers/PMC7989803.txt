college primarily became disenchanted fields felt attracted alternative fields study identified students intending pursue biomedical fields study early college collected data beliefs performance throughout college interviewed near graduation future plans Descriptively examined topics students discussed affecting attrition decisions Predictive research aims determine academic performance interest demographic factors predicted students likelihood overall attrition likelihood reporting distinct reasons attrition Among students left biomedical fields described leaving terms feeling disenchanted whereas expressed left least part due feeling attracted towards nonbiomedical fields students left biomedical fields expressed changing plans reasons related interest especially prevalent among students reported leaving due attraction towards nonbiomedical fields Predictive analyses showed interest biology grades end introductory biology course predicted likelihood overall attrition likelihood leaving due feeling disenchantment whereas underrepresented ethnic minority status predicted outcomes positively Interest course grades also predicted likelihood students leaving due feeling attraction towards fields interest stronger predictor relative grades Results highlight distinct types attrition may implications policies promote STEM retention Keywords expectancyvalue theory interest STEM biomedical fields college attrition Across variety careers increasing need individuals proficient science technology engineering mathematics STEM skills data analysis analytical reasoning Association American Colleges Universities National Science Board However percent students enter college intending complete degree STEM achieve goal thus lose opportunities develop STEM skills Chen National Science Board Furthermore individuals African American HispanicLatinao andor Native American ie underrepresented racialethnic minority students even likely leave STEM majors career paths compared peers eg Beasley Fisher Chang Sharkness Hurtado Newman Shaw Barbuti order alter trends critical educators understand students leave STEM fields study college present study examines students explanations leaving one important category STEM fields biological medical sciences hereafter referred biomedical fields large body research examined factors personal characteristics predict attrition STEM fields including biomedical fields identifying several key predictors poor performance introductory STEM courses Chen low interest value STEM coursework Seymour Hewitt work focused negative experiences perceptions STEM eg difficulty social costs might cause students lose interest feel less confident become dissatisfied STEM refer perceptions andor experiences paper students feeling disenchantment STEM fields work critically important particularly respect developing educational supports encourage students stay STEM However students leave STEM fields feel negatively STEM Rather students leave positive experiences majors career paths make feel attraction towards nonSTEM fields Seymour Hewitt Strenta Thoman et al Distinguishing students leave due feelings disenchantment versus attraction important two reasons First provides nuanced understanding students experiences two types attrition likely carry different meanings students particular students feel left attracted nonSTEM fields may think leaving positively students feel left due disenchantment STEM Second distinction implications strategies promote STEM degree attainment Understanding factors make students feel disenchanted STEM fields may help inform retention support strategies best prevent students perceiving fields negatively contrast understanding factors attract students towards nonSTEM fields help educators learn students might perceive nonSTEM fields appealing eg fields seem interesting students think successful fields open question whether students perceive attrition positively encouraged remain STEM majors career paths educators want retain students might able use students insights reframe STEM fields way make fields seem similarly appealing date little research explored whether students abandon STEM fields postsecondary education feel strongly left due disenchantment STEM fields study opposed attraction towards nonSTEM fields Thus clear frequently students report leaving STEM fields due disenchantment opposed attraction students experiences attraction nonSTEM fields look like factors predict students reporting disenchantment attraction primary reason leaving STEM fields present study aimed address questions respect biomedical fields Factors Affect STEM Attrition present study builds upon large body prior research explored students pursuit STEM fields different points educational trajectories Many factors influence students motivation persistence including prevent students ever wanting pursue STEM field study college first place eg low performance interest math science secondary school Heilbronner Maltese Tai focus study factors influence attrition students entered college desire pursue STEM major career path critical attrition point respect students leaving STEM educational trajectories eg Chen Extant work topic examined psychological processes associated college STEM attrition well demographic differences attrition rates Psychological processes One prominent theoretical models used understand explain students academic choices choosing biomedical major career path Eccles colleagues expectancyvalue theory motivation theory posits two primary psychological variables influence academic choices students expectations successful given academic field case biomedical field b extent value field terms useful interesting important see Wigfield Tonks Klauda review Expectancyvalue theory assumes students experiences STEM fields including performance STEM courses interactions peers faculty STEM professionals affect choices pursue STEM major indirectly affecting expectancies competencerelated beliefs task values Eccles Wang Degol According perspective students likely leave STEM fields low confidence andor low value intended majors career paths motivational processes influenced students achievement experiences college courses Research exploring attrition STEM fields college provides support expectancyvalue perspective Research shown students perceptions competence STEM field predict intentions remain field choices take STEM courses college eg Lent et al Perez et al Furthermore although grades competencerelated beliefs one another grades direct source information college students receive competence likely success given subject grades may good indicator competencerelated beliefs expectancyvalue formulation allow synthesis different lines research Specifically large body research shown poor performance college STEM courses one strongest predictors attrition STEM fields eg Chen King Ost particularly introductory courses serve gateways advanced courses major Maltese Tai Students perceptions value STEM fields also influence likelihood remaining fields eg Perez Cromley Kaplan Perez et al particular college students interest given major career path strong predictor STEM persistence eg Maltese Melki Wiebke Renninger Hidi Renninger Neilsen Nam Seymour Hewitt Strenta et al fact Maltese Melki Wiebki found many students persisted STEM college listed interest field primary factor determining persistence opposed getting good grades social influences careereconomic opportunities Seymour Hewitt interviewed students left STEM majors college found students frequently cited loss interest STEM fields growing interest fields primary reasons changing plans Similarly Strenta et al found students left science majors agreed statement switched science fields interesting p Demographic differences Research demographic differences STEM attrition shown compared peers African American HispanicLatinoa students well firstgeneration college students ie neither parent fouryear college degree less likely pursue STEM majors initially likely drop STEM fields college Beasley Fisher Chang et al National Science Board Shaw Barbuti Many researchers also studied gender differences STEM attrition eg Cheryan Ziegler Montoya Jiang National Science Board Wang Degol review However gender differences attrition depend particular STEM subfield studied eg physics biology pattern differential attrition college biomedical fields Cheryan et al National Science Board many different reasons underrepresented racialethnic minority URM students firstgeneration FG college students might likely leave biomedical fields course expectancyvalue psychological processes outlined may play important role average URM students FG students receive poorer grades White students continuinggeneration CG students introductory STEM courses part likely arrive college less academic preparation Chang et al Dika DAmico Lower performance introductory courses decrease competencerelated beliefs STEM fields contribute higher rates attrition Moreover evidence suggests URM students struggle perceive value STEM fields Perez trends contribute higher attrition among underrepresented students URM FG students also face unique challenges may affect attrition independently task values competence perceptions Students underrepresented groups may experience identity threat result perceiving negative stereotypes academic performance racial ethnic group Cohen Garcia Steele Aronson Steele Spencer Aronson socioeconomic background Harackiewicz et al Ostrove Long experience threat heighten daily stress students members underrepresented groups impair academic performance undermine perceptions belonging STEM fields Beasley Fischer Steele Spencer Aronson Walton Cohen Students Leave Disenchantment STEM Attraction Fields research reviewed identifies several factors may cause students feel disenchantment STEM fields perceiving competent successful given STEM field b perceiving lack value interest STEM courses careers c perceiving sense identity threat STEM classroom work environments important mitigate perceptions indeed growing body intervention research suggests attrition reduced educators conduct interventions address factors see Harackiewicz Priniski Walton Wilson reviews However exclusive focus factors misses fact many students change majors STEM fields dont abandon STEM students intend remain college switch another field Thus students considering switching majors likely think factors make want leave STEM fields ie factors make feel disenchantment factors make want pursue alternative fields ie factors attract towards nonSTEM fields students likely consider features STEM nonSTEM fields deciding change fields study students leave STEM fields likely feel disenchantment STEM well attraction fields However students may differ extent view disenchantment STEM fields versus attraction nonSTEM fields influential decision change plans students may think attrition primarily terms negative perceptions experiences STEM fields led feelings disenchantment students may think attrition primarily terms positive perceptions experiences nonSTEM fields attracted away Still students may think attraction disenchantment factors equal weight differences students think decisions may consequential noted students feel attraction toward nonSTEM field may view attrition STEM positive terms think primarily disenchantment STEM fields Moreover different reasons may implications best support students present study use students explanations changed plans away biomedical fields indicator predominant ways thought attrition fields gain insights regarding different students reflections may distinct one another Eccles argued students deciding academic major career pursue compare values associated different fields study research explored topic empirically examining students compare perceptions value competence STEM fields versus fields deciding whether pursue STEM careers Diekman Brown Johnston Clark Gaspard Wille Wormington Hulleman Lauermann Chow Eccles Ost Wang Eccles Kenny work focused negative side comparisons ie relatively low perceptions value competence relative fields make students less likely pursue STEM studies begun examine comparisons might involve students feeling attracted nonSTEM fields two studies researchers found college students left STEM fields mentioned appeal nonSTEM career paths primary factor influencing change plans Seymour Hewitt Strenta et al work Thoman et al found female students perceptions belonging nonSTEM domains predicted leaving STEM majors Considered together research suggests depending aspects STEMnonSTEM comparisons salient students students might reflect attrition STEM primarily terms disenchantment STEM fields primarily terms attraction fields combination two Despite initial work studies examined prevalence relative importance disenchantment versus attraction students attrition decisionmaking processes result little known frequently students think leaving STEM fields primarily terms disenchantment versus attraction whether students report leaving primarily due disenchantment differ report leaving due feeling attraction towards fields Furthermore unclear factors predict students feeling left STEM fields reasons related disenchantment versus attraction possible factors discussed impacting STEM attrition generally eg poor course performance demographic differences relevant predicting students leaving due disenchantment STEM fields predict leaving due attraction fields strongly knowledge research addressed types attractiondisenchantment tensions STEM attrition directly qualitative study Seymour Hewitt interviewed students left STEM majors college wrote students pulled pushed STEM fields whereas students pushed pulled p test factors might predict

biology chemistry classes students group referenced interest fit related experiences opposed experiences related job rewards opportunities example students referenced courses perceived boring career plans lost interest perceived fit well lack satisfaction andor passion original major career plan Thirty students explained leaving terms reasons related disenchantment referenced confidence ability primary reason changing plans away biomedical fields students often expressed one two reasons changing plans students indicated would unable meet admissions requirements graduate school chosen career example one student wrote career plans changed succeed science courses enough able enter physician assistant school graduating high enough grades core science classes apply students indicated poor performance prerequisite courses STEM major drove away biomedical fields student stated Intro Biology proved weed class struggling wanted teacher always back mind everyone family teachers wanted try different route class huge challenge learned early beginning class meant cases issues interestvalue confidenceability interacted affect students decisions example one student described poor

impossible made longer interested pursuing sciencerelated degree Finally students indicated left primarily costs barriers associated biomedical majors career paths students either reported external barriers made biomedical degree seem much challenging eg death family articulated believe time cost psychological toll pursuing particular biomedical career worth example one student wrote plans changed didnt want spend many years school going medical school Another student expressed Medical school Thats really need say Although love sciences desire help Latinos underrepresented groups community still huge part certain point could mentally go Students left due attraction students discussed leaving due feeling attraction towards nonbiomedical fields responses almost interest value new majors career paths n students discussed attraction reasons leaving two students responses vague classify students coursework attracted away biomedical field One student wrote used want go medical field mainly physicians assistant However taking Intro Sociology concurrently Intro Biology fell love Sociology decided major Another student stated plans changed discovered passion creative writing students positive aspects various career paths drew away One student wrote planning applying medical school gained experience psychology field direct patient care changed focus toward obtaining PhD Similar students expressed disenchantment vast majority students expressed leaving due attraction discussed change terms interest fitrelated experiences rather job rewards opportunities majority students attraction group articulated point baseline follow clear initial career plans However small subgroup students n expressed somewhat undecided initial career plans prior feeling attracted nonbiomedical fields students stated either weak commitment initial profession eg took Intro Bio course prerequisite optometry school similar medical degree keep options open complete lack commitment initial career plans despite reported interest biomedical major baseline time point eg figured going time students initial uncertainty career plans may made open perceiving attractive features alternative fields Students left due disenchantment attraction Among students expressed disenchantment attraction factors explanations left biomedical fields students referenced topics related interest value Similar groups students often discussed interest fitrelated experiences opposed experiences related job rewards opportunities particular many students referenced loss interest

longterm career paths Meanwhile business certificate required take economics courses found intrigued realized order able economic research would need much stronger background mathematics statistics Finding particularly interested forecasting prediction decided statistics way go really love Among students referencing interest value wide variation order students reported experiencing disenchantment versus attraction case students first experienced disenchantment attraction Five students reported loss interest perceived fit initial field study caused search alternative options point considered positive aspects alternative fields example one student expressed completing biology organic chemistry decided med school decided pursue interest counseling psychology However two students expressed positive experiences new field study drove realize dissatisfied original majors career plans Additionally four students described change plans simultaneous stating point decided interests better aligned one field study versus another example one student stated decided longer interested sciences much used realized really loved serving people various avenues relationships Finally four students group noted experiences related confidence ability central reason behind change plans Three students quotations stated low perceptions competence low ability primary determinant

major career utilizes biomedical competencies lies within nonbiomedical field Given importance STEM skills STEM nonSTEM careers National Science Board efforts could ensure interested students continue develop important STEM competencies without asking give options identify third possibility educators accept students decisions move fields focus retention efforts students responses students left primarily due attraction also shed light attract undecided nonbiomedical students biomedical majors careers particular students left due attraction expressed enthusiasm interest features nonbiomedical coursework careers contrasts sharply descriptions biomedical fields given students left due disenchantment biomedical fields descriptions often made extant literature introductory lecturebased STEM courses dense boring tedious also see Seymour Hewitt Gasiewski Eagan Garcia Hurtado Chang Presidents Council Advisors Science Technology educators strive make introductory biomedical coursework stimulating engaging might evoke greater enthusiasm undecided nonbiomedical students possibly draw fields towards biomedical fields students expressed leaving biomedical fields primarily due feelings disenchantment half discussed factors made lose interest original major career path perceive valuable eg found coursework boring would enjoy daytoday tasks associated particular career Another students referenced low confidence perceived ability primary factor influencing decisions eg could get medical school students report perceiving positive aspects new field study Educators best support students trying address factors make students perceive STEM coursework boring difficult order help prevent leaving biomedical fields without strong desire pursue alternative field also may useful help students perceive difficulty courses worthwhile positive challenge may help frame negative experiences positive light thus feel less demoralized experiences Finally preemptive measures ensure students informed types coursework pursue en route given major daytoday tasks associated certain careers may help prevent students engaging fields study ultimately lead disappointment Predicting Attrition Feelings Disenchantment Feelings Attraction Another goal study explore factors predicted whether students left biomedical fields primarily due disenchantment attraction Although much prior research examined factors predict attrition STEM fields research distinguished different types attrition examined whether different factors predict two types overall attrition results generally consistent prior research eg Chen Eccles Perez et al Controlling baseline interest prior achievement students earned lower grades introductory biology course students lower interest biology end course significantly likely leave biomedical fields compared remaining fields Also consistent prior research found URM students significantly likely leave biomedical fields majority students Beasley Fisher Chang et al Shaw Barbuti National Science Board Process analyses suggested students higher attrition associated part received lower biology course grades Results highlight critical importance addressing racial ethnic achievement gaps STEM courses route reduce STEM attrition Educators try address goal helping ensure URM students receive appropriate educational supports help succeed introductory college STEM courses Interventions aim promote interest perceptions belonging course performance underrepresented students may particularly helpful regard eg Brown Smith Thoman Allen Muragashi Cohen Garcia Apfel Master Harackiewicz Smith Priniski Walton Cohen Results inconsistent prior research FG status predict attrition models using demographic predictors fact FG students less likely leave due feelings disenchantment models included psychological predictors finding suggests FG students particularly motivated remain biomedical fields reasons beyond achievement interest biology possible FG students major career decisions impacted unique set factors captured current study Stephens Markus Phillips encourage researchers test whether finding replicates contexts study dynamics attrition FG students across different STEM fields future research respect distinct types attrition found many factors predicting overall attrition also predicted students leaving biomedical fields due disenchantment compared remaining fields biology course grades interest biology end semester URM status results consistent interview responses suggesting low interest biomedical subjects low perceptions competence biomedical courses two key factors made students want leave biomedical fields findings underscore conclusions drawn path prevent students perceiving STEM fields negatively educators try help succeed challenging introductory courses particularly URM students may receive lower grades addition trying emphasize interesting features STEM fields study students lives Results predicting students leaving due attraction fields quite different Reporting lower interest end introductory biology course lower course grades associated leaving due attraction compared remaining biomedical fields controlling baseline interest prior achievement However endofsemester interest somewhat stronger predictor relative course grades appears students felt attracted nonbiomedical fields heavily influenced biology course grades students felt disenchantment biomedical fields Given two groups significantly different course performance may students respond poorly low biology course grades become likely think attrition disenchantmentrelated terms relatively higher frequency disenchantment students referencing competence ability interviews supports supposition suggests low grades salient group case students left due attraction unaffected biology course grades students seem somewhat strongly affected factors related interest terms declining interest biomedicine increasing interest another field Interest biology strongest predictor students leaving due attraction regression models contrasts interview responses students group often reference declining interest biology instead often referenced growing interest fields primary determinant plans changing Even attraction disenchantment group provides clearest information students decisionmaking processes respect old new majors less half students stated loss interest biomedical fields caused notice seek positive experiences fields findings suggest perceiving low interest biology relative ones peers may make students susceptible attracted towards alternative fields students might realize low interest played salient role decisions Research grounded expectancyvalue theory reports high school students perceive values hierarchy across subjects students perceive strong value one subject may come devalue subjects fields closely related Eccles Gaspard et al Guo Marsh Parker Morin Dicke Lauermann et al present study may case students began perceive low interest biomedical fields likely perceive higher interest fields time without necessarily aware shift Together findings suggest students experience low interest biology positive interest fit experiences fields particularly likely feel attracted towards nonbiomedical fields also found interaction suggesting effects endofsemester biology interest leaving due attraction versus remaining biomedical fields strongest highestachieving students controlling baseline interest prior achievement surprising low interest may impactful students higher course performance Higherperforming students may feel capable making decisions based comparing interests across different fields relatively successful introductory biology course might assume capable succeeding alternative majors well contrast lowerperforming students may concerned finding field perform well thus might give interests less weight deciding whether change fields study Broadly qualitative quantitative findings point critical importance interest shaping students decisions leaving biomedical fields reason Harackiewicz Smith Priniski Renninger Hidi study students entered biology course interest pursuing biomedical career interest end course proved least strong predictor course performance types attrition High levels endofsemester interest associated remaining field whereas lower levels endofsemester interest associated leaving field Much attention given role poor performance introductory courses predicting attrition eg Chen already discussed critical consider equal importance interest shaping students attrition decisions educators want ensure students continue take STEM courses future perceive STEM fields study positively important ensure course material stimulating students perceive value studying Otherwise risk losing students come course high initial interest choosing opt fields time Conclusions Future Directions recommend researchers build upon findings present study examining attraction disenchantment related reasons leaving broader variety STEM subjects different populations STEM college students believe findings presented generalizable STEM subjects may additional factors consider STEM disciplines example may gender differences reasons attrition STEM fields physics engineering women seriously underrepresented among students faculty work force National Science Foundation fields characterized lack role models lower sense belonging women Walton Logel Peach Spencer Zanna well experiences gender bias peers professors Robnett terms nonSTEM subject areas assume results presented would generalize types major changes eg changing business major humanities major Although individuals likely would consider attraction disenchantment reasons leaving subject areas prevalence different reasons attrition factors predicting types attrition would likely differ across subject areas Similarly present study treated students remained biomedical major career similarly much variability students career pursuits within fields could provide additional insight regarding students change career plans throughout course college Another limitation collected data regarding psychological predictors attrition Future researchers explore role psychological predictors predicting distinct types attrition understand topic particular study utilized course grades prior achievement predictors expectancyvalue theory would suggest students competencerelated beliefs actual competence proximal predictors motivated academic behavior believe grades serve useful indicator competencerelated beliefs future research explore depth whether beliefs predict types attrition ways distinct grades study explored one dimension students reasons attrition STEM fields disenchantment versus attraction Although believe dimension one critical understanding students leave STEM fields also may important dimensions STEM major choices informative whether students felt internal factors shaped decisionmaking eg low confidence whether external interactions experiences influential eg conversations advisor final limitation present study sufficient sample size address questions related intersectionality among demographic variables Students intersecting gender social class racial ethnic identities shape experiences college STEM courses ways understood examining one demographic factor time eg ElseQuest Hyde Harackiewicz et al recommend researchers build upon results reported examining students intersecting identities relate decisions remain leave STEM majors Broadly designed present study shed light attraction disenchantmentrelated dynamics may cause students leave STEM fields results may help educators understand reasons different students leave STEM fields may ultimately help provide effective equitable education Educational Impact Implications Statement study shows students reflect attrition biomedical fields study college distinct ways Results interviews demonstrated many students reported leaving biomedical fields felt disenchanted however students reported leaving biomedical fields least part due feeling attracted positive features nonbiomedical fields biology grades interest affected students likelihood leaving biomedical fields two factors predicted leaving due disenchantment equally strongly whereas interest played stronger role compared grades predicting whether students left due attraction towards fields study points importance considering positive factors associated alternative fields shape students attrition instead focusing negative factors make students feel disenchanted biomedical fields also reinforces prior research demonstrating need support students interest perceived

important category STEM fields biological medical sciences hereafter referred biomedical fields large body research examined factors personal characteristics predict attrition STEM fields including biomedical fields identifying several key predictors poor performance introductory STEM courses Chen low interest value STEM coursework Seymour Hewitt work focused negative experiences perceptions STEM eg difficulty social costs might cause students lose interest feel less confident become dissatisfied STEM refer perceptions andor experiences paper students feeling disenchantment STEM fields work critically important particularly respect developing educational supports encourage students stay STEM However students leave STEM fields feel negatively STEM Rather students leave positive experiences majors career paths make feel attraction towards nonSTEM fields Seymour Hewitt Strenta Thoman et al Distinguishing students leave due feelings disenchantment versus attraction important two reasons First provides nuanced understanding students experiences two types attrition likely carry different meanings students particular students feel left attracted nonSTEM fields may think leaving positively students feel left due disenchantment STEM Second distinction implications strategies promote STEM degree attainment Understanding factors make students feel disenchanted STEM fields may help inform retention support strategies best prevent students perceiving fields negatively contrast understanding factors attract students towards nonSTEM fields help educators learn students might perceive nonSTEM fields appealing eg fields seem interesting students think successful fields open question whether students perceive attrition positively encouraged remain STEM majors career paths educators want retain students might able use students insights reframe STEM fields way make fields seem similarly appealing date little research explored whether students abandon STEM fields postsecondary education feel strongly left due disenchantment STEM fields study opposed attraction towards nonSTEM fields Thus clear frequently students report leaving STEM fields due disenchantment opposed attraction students experiences attraction nonSTEM fields look like factors predict students reporting disenchantment attraction primary reason leaving STEM fields present study aimed address questions respect biomedical fields Factors Affect STEM Attrition present study builds upon large body prior research explored students pursuit STEM fields different points educational trajectories Many factors influence students motivation persistence including prevent students ever wanting pursue STEM field study college first place eg low performance interest math science secondary school Heilbronner Maltese Tai focus study factors influence attrition students entered college desire pursue STEM major career path critical attrition point respect students leaving STEM educational trajectories eg Chen Extant work topic examined psychological processes associated college STEM attrition well demographic differences attrition rates Psychological processes One prominent theoretical models used understand explain students academic choices choosing biomedical major career path Eccles colleagues expectancyvalue theory motivation theory posits two primary psychological variables influence academic choices students expectations successful given academic field case biomedical field b extent value field terms useful interesting important see Wigfield Tonks Klauda review Expectancyvalue theory assumes students experiences STEM fields including performance STEM courses interactions peers faculty STEM professionals affect choices pursue STEM major indirectly affecting expectancies competencerelated beliefs task values Eccles Wang Degol According perspective students likely leave STEM fields low confidence andor low value intended majors career paths motivational processes influenced students achievement experiences college courses Research exploring attrition STEM fields college provides support expectancyvalue perspective Research shown students

Steele Spencer Aronson Walton Cohen Students Leave Disenchantment STEM Attraction Fields research reviewed identifies several factors may cause students feel disenchantment STEM fields perceiving competent successful given STEM field b perceiving lack value interest STEM courses careers c perceiving sense identity threat STEM classroom work environments important mitigate perceptions indeed growing body intervention research suggests attrition reduced educators conduct interventions address factors see Harackiewicz Priniski Walton Wilson reviews However exclusive focus factors misses fact many students change majors STEM fields dont abandon STEM students intend remain college switch another field Thus students considering switching majors likely think factors make want leave STEM fields ie factors make feel disenchantment factors make want pursue alternative fields ie factors attract towards nonSTEM fields students likely consider features STEM nonSTEM fields deciding change fields study students leave STEM fields likely feel disenchantment STEM well attraction fields However students may differ extent view disenchantment STEM fields versus attraction nonSTEM fields influential decision change plans students may think attrition primarily terms negative perceptions experiences STEM fields led feelings disenchantment students may think attrition primarily terms positive perceptions experiences nonSTEM fields attracted away Still students may think attraction disenchantment factors equal weight differences students think decisions may consequential noted students feel attraction toward nonSTEM field may view attrition STEM positive terms think primarily disenchantment STEM fields Moreover different reasons may implications best support students present study use students explanations changed plans away biomedical fields indicator predominant ways thought attrition fields gain insights regarding different students reflections may distinct one

competence STEM fields versus fields deciding whether pursue STEM careers Diekman Brown Johnston Clark Gaspard Wille Wormington Hulleman Lauermann Chow Eccles Ost Wang Eccles Kenny work focused negative side comparisons ie relatively low perceptions value competence relative fields make students less likely pursue STEM studies begun examine comparisons might involve students feeling

Thoman et al found female students perceptions belonging nonSTEM domains predicted leaving STEM majors Considered together research suggests depending aspects STEMnonSTEM comparisons salient students students might reflect attrition STEM primarily terms disenchantment STEM fields primarily terms attraction fields combination two Despite initial work studies examined prevalence relative importance disenchantment versus attraction students attrition decisionmaking processes result little known frequently students think leaving STEM fields primarily terms disenchantment versus attraction whether

whether students started college biomedical fields study left fields became disenchanted whether students left felt attracted features nonbiomedical fields Although students leave STEM fields college likely think negative aspects original field study positive aspects new field study deciding major career path results present study demonstrate substantial variability whether students predominantly reflected attrition terms reasons related attraction versus disenchantment Indeed large proportion students left biomedical fields explained attrition terms least positive features attracted towards nonbiomedical field study one quarter students explained attrition exclusively terms attraction factors results highlight importance considering factors may cause students perceive STEM fields negatively also factors might make students perceive fields study positively order obtain nuanced understanding STEM attrition findings consistent growing body research eg Diekman et al Eccles Gaspard et al Ost suggesting students consider aspects STEM nonSTEM majors careers deciding leave STEM fields study also provide evidence kinds attractiondisenchantment tensions discussed prior research Seymour Hewitt Thoman et al results extend prior work examining relative importance students place attraction versus disenchantment explaining attrition decisions examining factors predict distinct types attrition important understand experiences students report leaving due feeling attraction versus disenchantment order provide different students appropriate educational supports Results interviews offer suggestions develop supports Students expressed leaving due attraction almost described perceiving high interest value nonbiomedical majors career paths students referencing interest fit occurred despite students clear initial plans pursue biomedical careers suggesting students cancould drawn towards positive aspects alternative fields even thought initially committed certain career Students emphasis interest enjoyment nonbiomedical fields fit fields suggest intrinsic attainment components students task values may key determinants leaving due fields attraction educators want retain students biomedical fields need focus reducing barriers success within biomedical fields Rather need make positive case biomedical fields emphasizing interesting features fields support students sense identification One option may try support students academic values across different domains simultaneously emphasizing interdisciplinary topics include biomedical material encouraging students pursue biomedical fields study alongside fields eg double major career utilizes biomedical competencies lies within nonbiomedical field Given importance STEM skills STEM nonSTEM careers National Science Board efforts could ensure interested students continue develop important STEM competencies without asking give options identify third possibility educators accept students decisions move fields focus retention efforts students responses students left primarily due attraction also shed light attract undecided nonbiomedical students biomedical majors careers particular students left due attraction expressed enthusiasm interest features nonbiomedical coursework careers contrasts sharply descriptions biomedical fields given students left due disenchantment biomedical fields descriptions often made extant literature introductory lecturebased STEM courses dense boring tedious also see Seymour Hewitt Gasiewski Eagan Garcia Hurtado Chang Presidents Council Advisors Science Technology educators strive make introductory biomedical coursework stimulating engaging might evoke greater enthusiasm undecided nonbiomedical students possibly draw fields towards biomedical fields students expressed leaving biomedical fields primarily due feelings disenchantment half discussed factors made lose interest original major career path perceive valuable eg found coursework boring would enjoy daytoday tasks associated particular career Another students referenced low confidence perceived ability primary factor influencing decisions eg could get medical school students report perceiving positive aspects new field study Educators best support students trying address factors make students perceive STEM coursework boring difficult order help prevent leaving biomedical fields without strong desire pursue alternative field also may useful help students perceive difficulty courses worthwhile positive challenge may help frame negative experiences positive light thus feel less demoralized experiences Finally preemptive measures ensure students informed types coursework pursue en route given major daytoday tasks associated certain careers may help prevent students engaging fields study ultimately lead disappointment Predicting Attrition Feelings Disenchantment Feelings Attraction Another goal study explore factors predicted whether students left biomedical fields primarily due disenchantment attraction Although much prior research examined factors predict attrition STEM fields research distinguished different types attrition examined whether different factors predict two types overall attrition results generally consistent prior research eg Chen Eccles Perez et al Controlling baseline interest prior achievement students earned lower grades introductory biology course students lower interest biology end course significantly likely leave biomedical fields compared remaining fields Also consistent prior research found URM students significantly likely leave biomedical fields majority students Beasley Fisher Chang et al Shaw Barbuti National Science Board Process analyses suggested students higher attrition associated part received lower biology course grades Results highlight critical importance addressing racial ethnic achievement gaps STEM courses route reduce STEM attrition Educators try address goal helping ensure URM students receive appropriate educational supports help succeed introductory college STEM courses Interventions aim promote interest perceptions belonging course performance underrepresented students may particularly helpful regard eg Brown Smith Thoman Allen Muragashi Cohen Garcia Apfel Master Harackiewicz Smith Priniski Walton Cohen Results inconsistent prior research FG status predict attrition models using demographic predictors fact FG students less likely leave due feelings disenchantment models included psychological predictors finding suggests FG students particularly motivated remain biomedical fields reasons beyond achievement interest biology possible FG students major career decisions impacted unique set factors captured current study Stephens Markus Phillips encourage researchers test whether finding replicates contexts study dynamics attrition FG students across different STEM fields future research respect distinct types attrition found many factors predicting overall attrition also predicted students leaving biomedical fields due disenchantment compared remaining fields biology course grades interest biology end semester URM status results consistent interview responses suggesting low interest biomedical subjects low perceptions competence biomedical courses two key factors made students want leave biomedical fields findings underscore conclusions drawn path prevent students perceiving STEM fields negatively educators try help succeed challenging introductory courses particularly URM students may receive lower grades addition trying emphasize interesting features STEM fields study students lives Results predicting students leaving due attraction fields quite different Reporting lower interest end introductory biology course lower course grades associated leaving due attraction compared remaining biomedical fields controlling baseline interest prior achievement However endofsemester interest somewhat stronger predictor relative course grades appears students felt attracted nonbiomedical fields heavily influenced biology course grades students felt disenchantment biomedical fields Given two groups significantly different course performance may students respond poorly low biology course grades become likely think attrition disenchantmentrelated terms relatively higher frequency disenchantment students referencing competence ability interviews supports supposition suggests low grades salient group case students left due attraction unaffected biology course grades students seem somewhat strongly affected factors related interest terms declining interest biomedicine increasing interest another field Interest biology strongest predictor students leaving due attraction regression models contrasts interview responses students group often reference declining interest biology instead often referenced growing interest fields primary determinant plans changing Even attraction disenchantment group provides clearest information students decisionmaking processes respect old new majors less half students stated loss interest biomedical fields caused notice seek positive experiences fields findings suggest perceiving low interest biology relative ones peers may make students susceptible attracted towards alternative fields students might realize low interest played salient role decisions Research grounded expectancyvalue theory reports high school students perceive values hierarchy across subjects students perceive strong value one subject may come devalue subjects fields closely related Eccles Gaspard et al Guo Marsh Parker Morin Dicke Lauermann et al present study may case students began perceive low interest biomedical fields likely perceive higher interest fields time without necessarily aware shift Together findings suggest students experience low interest biology positive interest fit experiences fields particularly likely feel attracted towards nonbiomedical fields also found interaction suggesting effects endofsemester biology interest leaving due attraction versus remaining biomedical fields strongest highestachieving students controlling baseline interest prior achievement surprising low interest may impactful students higher course performance Higherperforming students may feel capable making decisions based comparing interests across different fields relatively successful introductory biology course might assume capable succeeding alternative majors well contrast lowerperforming students may concerned finding field perform well thus might give interests less weight deciding whether change fields study Broadly qualitative quantitative findings point critical importance interest shaping students decisions leaving biomedical fields reason Harackiewicz Smith Priniski Renninger Hidi study students entered biology course interest pursuing biomedical career interest end course proved least strong predictor course performance types attrition High levels endofsemester interest associated remaining field whereas lower levels endofsemester interest associated leaving field Much attention given role poor performance introductory courses predicting attrition eg Chen already discussed critical consider equal importance interest shaping students attrition decisions educators want ensure students continue take STEM courses future perceive STEM

Conclusions Future Directions recommend researchers build upon findings present study examining attraction disenchantment related reasons leaving broader variety STEM subjects different populations STEM college students believe findings presented generalizable STEM subjects may additional factors consider STEM disciplines example may gender differences reasons attrition STEM fields physics engineering women seriously underrepresented among students faculty work force National Science Foundation fields characterized lack role models lower sense belonging women Walton Logel Peach Spencer

Although individuals likely would consider attraction disenchantment reasons leaving subject areas prevalence different reasons attrition factors predicting types attrition would likely differ across subject areas Similarly present study treated students remained biomedical major career similarly much variability students career pursuits within fields could provide additional insight regarding students change career plans throughout course college Another limitation collected data regarding psychological predictors attrition Future researchers explore role psychological predictors predicting distinct types attrition understand topic particular study utilized course grades prior achievement predictors expectancyvalue theory would suggest students competencerelated beliefs actual competence proximal predictors motivated academic behavior believe grades serve useful indicator competencerelated beliefs future research explore depth whether beliefs predict types attrition ways distinct grades study explored one dimension students reasons attrition STEM fields disenchantment versus attraction Although believe dimension one critical understanding students leave STEM fields also may important dimensions STEM major choices informative whether students felt internal factors shaped decisionmaking eg low confidence whether external interactions experiences influential eg conversations advisor final limitation present study sufficient sample size address questions related intersectionality among demographic variables Students intersecting gender social class racial ethnic identities shape experiences college STEM courses ways understood examining one demographic factor time eg ElseQuest Hyde Harackiewicz et al recommend researchers build upon results reported examining students intersecting identities relate decisions remain leave STEM majors Broadly designed present study shed light attraction disenchantmentrelated dynamics may cause students leave STEM fields results may help educators understand reasons different students leave STEM fields may ultimately help provide effective equitable education Educational Impact Implications Statement study shows students reflect attrition biomedical fields study college distinct ways Results interviews demonstrated many students reported leaving biomedical fields felt disenchanted however students reported leaving biomedical fields least part due feeling attracted positive features nonbiomedical fields biology grades interest affected students likelihood leaving biomedical fields two factors predicted leaving due disenchantment equally strongly whereas interest played stronger role compared grades predicting whether students left due attraction towards fields study points importance

supports encourage students stay STEM However students leave STEM fields feel negatively STEM Rather students leave positive experiences majors career paths make feel attraction towards nonSTEM fields Seymour Hewitt Strenta Thoman et al Distinguishing students leave due feelings disenchantment versus attraction important two reasons First provides nuanced understanding students experiences two types attrition likely carry different meanings students particular students feel left attracted nonSTEM fields may think leaving positively students feel left due disenchantment STEM Second distinction implications strategies promote STEM degree attainment Understanding factors make students feel disenchanted STEM fields may help inform retention support strategies best prevent students perceiving fields negatively contrast understanding factors attract students towards nonSTEM fields help educators learn students might perceive nonSTEM fields appealing eg fields seem interesting students think successful fields open question whether students perceive attrition positively encouraged remain STEM majors career paths educators want retain students might able use students insights reframe STEM fields way make fields seem similarly appealing date little research explored whether students abandon STEM fields postsecondary education feel strongly left due disenchantment STEM fields study opposed attraction towards nonSTEM fields Thus clear frequently students report leaving STEM fields due disenchantment opposed attraction students experiences attraction nonSTEM fields look like factors predict students reporting disenchantment attraction primary reason leaving STEM fields present study aimed address questions respect biomedical fields Factors Affect STEM Attrition present study builds upon large body prior research explored students pursuit STEM fields different points educational trajectories Many factors influence students motivation persistence including prevent students ever wanting pursue STEM field study college first place eg low performance interest math science secondary school Heilbronner Maltese Tai focus study factors influence attrition students entered college desire pursue STEM major career path critical attrition point respect students leaving STEM educational trajectories eg Chen Extant work topic examined psychological processes associated college STEM attrition well demographic differences attrition rates Psychological processes One prominent theoretical models used understand explain students academic choices choosing biomedical major career path Eccles colleagues expectancyvalue theory motivation theory posits two primary psychological variables influence academic choices students expectations successful given academic field case biomedical field b extent value field terms useful interesting important see Wigfield Tonks Klauda review Expectancyvalue theory assumes students experiences STEM fields including performance STEM courses interactions peers faculty STEM professionals affect choices pursue STEM major indirectly affecting expectancies competencerelated beliefs task values Eccles Wang Degol According perspective students likely leave STEM fields low confidence andor low value intended majors career paths motivational processes influenced students achievement experiences college courses Research exploring attrition STEM fields college provides support expectancyvalue perspective Research shown students perceptions competence STEM field predict intentions remain field choices take STEM courses college eg Lent et al Perez et al Furthermore although grades competencerelated beliefs one another grades direct source information college students receive competence likely success given subject grades may good indicator competencerelated beliefs expectancyvalue formulation allow synthesis different lines research Specifically large body research shown poor performance college STEM courses one strongest predictors attrition STEM fields eg Chen King Ost particularly introductory courses serve gateways advanced courses major Maltese Tai Students perceptions value STEM fields also influence likelihood remaining fields eg Perez Cromley Kaplan Perez et al particular college students interest given major career path strong predictor STEM persistence eg Maltese Melki Wiebke Renninger Hidi Renninger Neilsen Nam Seymour Hewitt Strenta et al fact Maltese Melki Wiebki found many students persisted STEM college listed interest field primary factor determining persistence opposed getting good grades social influences careereconomic opportunities Seymour Hewitt interviewed students left STEM majors college found students frequently cited loss interest STEM fields growing interest fields primary reasons changing plans Similarly Strenta et al found students left science majors agreed statement switched science fields interesting p Demographic differences Research demographic differences STEM attrition shown compared peers African American HispanicLatinoa students well firstgeneration college students ie neither parent fouryear college degree less likely pursue STEM majors initially likely drop STEM fields college Beasley Fisher Chang et al National Science Board Shaw Barbuti Many researchers also studied gender differences STEM attrition eg Cheryan Ziegler Montoya Jiang National Science Board Wang Degol review However gender differences attrition depend particular STEM subfield studied eg physics biology pattern differential attrition college biomedical fields Cheryan et al National Science Board many different reasons underrepresented racialethnic minority URM students firstgeneration FG college students might likely leave biomedical fields course expectancyvalue psychological processes outlined may play important role average URM students FG students receive poorer grades White students continuinggeneration CG students introductory STEM courses part likely arrive college less academic preparation Chang et al Dika DAmico Lower performance introductory courses decrease competencerelated beliefs STEM fields contribute higher rates attrition Moreover evidence suggests URM students struggle perceive value STEM fields Perez trends contribute higher attrition among underrepresented students URM FG students also face unique challenges may affect attrition independently task values competence perceptions Students underrepresented groups may experience identity threat result perceiving negative stereotypes academic performance racial ethnic group Cohen Garcia Steele Aronson Steele Spencer Aronson socioeconomic background Harackiewicz et al Ostrove Long experience threat heighten daily stress students members underrepresented groups impair academic performance undermine perceptions belonging STEM fields Beasley Fischer Steele Spencer Aronson Walton Cohen Students Leave Disenchantment STEM Attraction Fields research reviewed identifies several factors may cause students feel disenchantment STEM fields perceiving competent successful given STEM field b perceiving lack value interest STEM courses careers c perceiving sense identity threat STEM classroom work environments important mitigate perceptions indeed growing body intervention research suggests attrition reduced educators conduct interventions address factors see Harackiewicz Priniski Walton Wilson reviews However exclusive focus factors misses fact many students change majors STEM fields dont abandon STEM students intend remain college switch another field Thus students considering switching majors likely think factors make want leave STEM fields ie factors make feel disenchantment factors make want pursue alternative fields ie factors attract towards nonSTEM fields students likely consider features STEM nonSTEM fields deciding change fields study students leave STEM fields likely feel disenchantment STEM well attraction fields However students may differ extent view disenchantment STEM fields versus attraction nonSTEM fields influential decision change plans students may think attrition primarily terms negative perceptions experiences STEM fields led feelings disenchantment students may think attrition primarily terms positive perceptions experiences nonSTEM fields attracted away Still students may think attraction disenchantment factors equal weight differences students think decisions may consequential noted students feel attraction toward nonSTEM field may view attrition STEM positive terms think primarily disenchantment STEM fields Moreover different reasons may implications best support students present study use students explanations changed plans away biomedical fields indicator predominant ways thought attrition fields gain insights regarding different students reflections may distinct one another Eccles argued students deciding academic major career pursue compare values associated different fields study research explored topic empirically examining students compare perceptions value competence STEM fields versus fields deciding whether pursue STEM careers Diekman Brown Johnston Clark Gaspard Wille Wormington Hulleman Lauermann Chow Eccles Ost Wang Eccles Kenny work focused negative side comparisons ie relatively low perceptions value competence relative fields make students less likely pursue STEM studies begun examine comparisons might involve students feeling attracted nonSTEM fields two studies researchers found college students left STEM fields

leaving STEM majors Considered together research suggests depending aspects STEMnonSTEM comparisons salient students students might reflect attrition STEM primarily terms disenchantment STEM fields primarily terms attraction fields combination two Despite initial work studies examined prevalence relative importance disenchantment versus attraction students attrition decisionmaking processes result little known frequently students think leaving STEM fields primarily terms disenchantment versus attraction whether students report leaving primarily due disenchantment differ report leaving

attrition results generally consistent prior research eg Chen Eccles Perez et al Controlling baseline interest prior achievement students earned lower grades introductory biology course students lower interest biology end course significantly likely leave biomedical fields compared remaining fields Also consistent prior research found URM students significantly likely leave biomedical fields majority students Beasley Fisher Chang et al Shaw Barbuti National Science Board Process analyses suggested students higher attrition associated part received lower biology course grades Results highlight critical importance addressing racial ethnic achievement gaps STEM courses route reduce STEM attrition Educators try address goal helping ensure URM students receive appropriate educational supports help succeed introductory college STEM courses Interventions aim promote interest perceptions belonging course performance underrepresented students may particularly helpful regard eg Brown Smith Thoman Allen Muragashi Cohen Garcia Apfel Master Harackiewicz Smith Priniski Walton Cohen Results inconsistent prior research FG status predict attrition models using demographic predictors fact FG students less likely leave due feelings disenchantment models included psychological predictors finding suggests FG students particularly motivated remain biomedical fields reasons beyond achievement interest biology possible FG students major career decisions impacted unique set factors captured current study Stephens Markus Phillips encourage researchers test whether finding replicates contexts study dynamics attrition FG students across different STEM fields future research respect distinct types attrition found many factors predicting overall attrition also predicted students leaving biomedical fields due disenchantment compared remaining fields biology course grades interest biology end semester URM status results consistent interview responses suggesting low interest biomedical subjects low perceptions competence biomedical courses two key factors made students want leave biomedical fields findings underscore conclusions drawn path prevent students perceiving STEM fields negatively educators try help succeed challenging introductory courses particularly URM students may receive lower grades addition trying emphasize interesting features STEM fields study students lives Results predicting students leaving due attraction fields quite different Reporting lower interest end introductory biology course lower course grades associated leaving due attraction compared remaining biomedical fields controlling baseline interest prior achievement However endofsemester interest somewhat stronger predictor relative course grades appears students felt attracted nonbiomedical fields heavily influenced biology course grades students felt disenchantment biomedical fields Given two groups significantly different course performance may students respond poorly low biology course grades become likely think attrition disenchantmentrelated terms relatively higher frequency disenchantment students referencing competence ability interviews supports supposition suggests low grades salient group case students left due attraction unaffected biology course grades students seem somewhat strongly affected factors related interest terms declining interest biomedicine increasing interest another field Interest biology strongest predictor students leaving due attraction regression models contrasts interview responses students group often reference declining interest biology instead often referenced growing interest fields primary determinant plans changing Even attraction disenchantment group provides clearest information students decisionmaking processes respect old new majors less half students stated loss interest biomedical fields caused notice seek positive experiences fields findings suggest perceiving low interest biology relative ones peers may make students susceptible attracted towards alternative fields students might realize low interest played salient role decisions Research grounded expectancyvalue theory reports high school students perceive values hierarchy across subjects students perceive strong value one subject may come devalue subjects fields closely related Eccles Gaspard et al Guo Marsh Parker Morin Dicke Lauermann et al present study may case students began perceive low interest biomedical fields likely perceive higher interest fields time without necessarily aware shift Together findings suggest students experience low interest biology positive interest fit experiences fields particularly likely feel attracted towards nonbiomedical fields also found interaction suggesting effects endofsemester biology interest leaving due attraction versus remaining biomedical fields strongest highestachieving students controlling baseline interest prior achievement surprising low interest may impactful students higher course performance Higherperforming students may feel capable making decisions based comparing interests across different fields relatively successful introductory biology course might assume capable succeeding alternative majors well contrast lowerperforming students may concerned finding field perform well thus might give interests less weight deciding whether change fields study Broadly qualitative quantitative findings point critical importance interest shaping students decisions leaving biomedical fields reason Harackiewicz Smith Priniski Renninger Hidi study students entered biology course interest pursuing biomedical career interest end course proved least strong predictor course performance types attrition High levels endofsemester interest associated remaining field whereas lower levels endofsemester interest associated leaving field Much attention given role poor performance introductory courses predicting attrition eg Chen already discussed critical consider equal importance interest shaping students attrition decisions educators want ensure students continue take STEM courses future perceive STEM fields study positively important ensure course material stimulating students perceive value studying Otherwise risk losing students come course high initial interest choosing opt fields time Conclusions Future Directions recommend researchers build upon findings present study examining attraction disenchantment related reasons leaving broader variety STEM subjects different populations STEM college students believe findings presented generalizable STEM subjects may additional factors consider STEM disciplines example may gender differences reasons attrition STEM fields physics engineering women seriously underrepresented among students faculty work force National Science Foundation fields characterized lack role models lower sense belonging women Walton Logel Peach Spencer Zanna well experiences gender bias peers professors Robnett terms nonSTEM subject areas assume results presented would generalize types major changes eg changing business major humanities major Although individuals likely would consider attraction disenchantment reasons leaving subject areas prevalence different reasons attrition factors predicting types attrition would likely differ across subject areas Similarly present study treated students remained biomedical major career similarly much variability students career pursuits within fields could provide additional insight regarding students change career plans throughout course college Another limitation collected data regarding psychological predictors attrition Future researchers explore role psychological predictors predicting distinct types attrition understand topic particular study utilized course grades prior achievement predictors expectancyvalue theory would suggest students competencerelated beliefs actual competence proximal predictors motivated academic behavior believe grades serve useful indicator competencerelated beliefs future research explore depth whether beliefs predict types attrition ways distinct grades study explored one dimension students reasons attrition STEM fields disenchantment versus attraction Although believe dimension one critical understanding students leave STEM fields also may important dimensions STEM major choices informative whether students felt internal factors shaped decisionmaking eg low confidence whether external interactions experiences influential eg conversations advisor final limitation present study sufficient sample size address questions related intersectionality among demographic variables Students intersecting gender social class racial ethnic identities shape experiences college STEM courses ways understood examining one demographic factor time eg ElseQuest Hyde Harackiewicz et al recommend researchers build upon results reported examining students intersecting identities relate decisions remain leave STEM majors Broadly designed present study shed light attraction disenchantmentrelated dynamics may cause students leave STEM fields results may help educators understand reasons different students leave STEM fields may ultimately help provide effective equitable education Educational Impact Implications Statement study shows students reflect attrition biomedical fields study college distinct ways Results interviews demonstrated many students reported leaving biomedical fields felt disenchanted however students reported leaving biomedical fields least part due feeling attracted positive features nonbiomedical fields biology grades interest affected students likelihood leaving biomedical fields two factors predicted leaving due disenchantment equally strongly whereas interest played stronger role compared grades predicting whether students left due attraction towards fields study points importance considering positive factors associated alternative fields shape students attrition instead focusing negative factors make students feel disenchanted biomedical fields also reinforces prior research

Abstract study examined whether students left biomedical fields study college primarily became disenchanted fields felt attracted alternative fields study identified students intending pursue biomedical fields study early college collected data beliefs performance throughout college interviewed near graduation future plans Descriptively examined topics students discussed affecting attrition decisions Predictive research aims determine academic performance interest demographic factors predicted students likelihood overall attrition likelihood reporting distinct reasons attrition Among students left biomedical fields described leaving terms feeling disenchanted whereas expressed left least part due feeling attracted towards nonbiomedical fields students left biomedical fields expressed changing plans reasons related interest especially prevalent among students reported leaving due attraction towards nonbiomedical fields Predictive analyses showed interest biology grades end introductory biology course predicted likelihood overall attrition likelihood leaving due feeling disenchantment whereas underrepresented ethnic minority status predicted outcomes positively Interest course grades also predicted likelihood students leaving due feeling attraction towards fields interest stronger predictor relative grades Results highlight distinct types attrition may implications policies promote STEM retention Keywords expectancyvalue theory interest STEM biomedical fields college attrition Across variety careers increasing need individuals proficient science

underrepresented racialethnic minority students even likely leave STEM majors career paths compared peers eg Beasley Fisher Chang Sharkness Hurtado Newman Shaw Barbuti order alter trends critical educators understand students leave STEM fields study college present study examines students explanations leaving one important category STEM fields biological medical sciences hereafter referred biomedical fields large body research examined factors personal characteristics predict attrition STEM fields including biomedical fields identifying several key predictors poor performance introductory STEM courses Chen low interest value STEM coursework Seymour Hewitt work focused negative experiences perceptions STEM eg difficulty social costs might cause students lose interest feel less confident become dissatisfied STEM refer perceptions andor experiences paper students feeling disenchantment STEM fields work critically important particularly respect developing educational supports encourage students stay STEM However students leave STEM fields feel negatively STEM Rather students leave positive experiences majors career paths make feel attraction towards nonSTEM fields Seymour Hewitt Strenta Thoman et al Distinguishing students leave due feelings disenchantment versus attraction important two reasons First provides nuanced understanding students experiences two types attrition likely carry different meanings students particular students feel left attracted nonSTEM fields may think leaving positively students feel left due disenchantment STEM Second distinction implications strategies promote STEM degree attainment Understanding factors make students feel disenchanted STEM fields may help inform retention support strategies best prevent students perceiving fields negatively contrast understanding factors attract students towards nonSTEM fields help educators learn students might perceive nonSTEM fields appealing eg fields seem interesting students think successful fields open question whether students perceive attrition positively encouraged remain STEM majors career paths educators want retain students might able use students insights reframe STEM fields way make fields seem similarly appealing date little research explored whether students abandon STEM fields postsecondary education feel strongly left due disenchantment STEM fields study opposed attraction towards nonSTEM fields Thus clear frequently students report leaving STEM fields due disenchantment opposed attraction students experiences attraction nonSTEM fields look like factors predict students reporting disenchantment attraction primary reason leaving STEM fields present study aimed address questions respect biomedical fields Factors Affect STEM Attrition present study builds upon large body prior research explored students pursuit STEM fields different points educational trajectories Many factors influence students motivation persistence including prevent students ever wanting pursue STEM field study college first place eg low performance interest math science secondary school Heilbronner Maltese Tai focus study factors influence attrition students entered college desire pursue STEM major career path critical attrition point respect students leaving STEM educational trajectories eg Chen Extant work topic examined psychological processes associated college STEM attrition well demographic differences attrition rates Psychological processes One prominent theoretical models used understand explain students academic choices choosing biomedical major career path Eccles colleagues expectancyvalue theory motivation theory posits two primary psychological variables influence academic choices students expectations successful given academic field case biomedical field b extent value field terms useful interesting important see Wigfield Tonks Klauda review Expectancyvalue theory assumes students experiences STEM fields including performance STEM courses interactions peers faculty STEM professionals affect choices pursue STEM major indirectly affecting expectancies competencerelated beliefs task values Eccles Wang Degol According perspective students likely leave STEM fields low confidence andor low value intended majors career paths motivational processes influenced students achievement experiences college courses Research exploring attrition STEM fields college provides support expectancyvalue perspective Research shown students perceptions competence STEM field predict intentions remain field choices take STEM courses college eg Lent et al Perez et al Furthermore although grades competencerelated beliefs one another grades direct source information college students receive competence likely success given subject grades may good indicator competencerelated beliefs expectancyvalue formulation allow synthesis different lines research Specifically large body research shown poor performance college STEM courses one strongest predictors attrition STEM fields eg Chen King Ost particularly introductory courses serve gateways advanced courses major Maltese Tai Students perceptions value STEM fields also influence likelihood remaining fields eg Perez Cromley Kaplan Perez et al particular college students interest given major career path strong predictor STEM persistence eg Maltese Melki Wiebke Renninger Hidi Renninger Neilsen Nam Seymour Hewitt Strenta et al fact Maltese Melki Wiebki found many students persisted STEM college listed interest field primary factor determining persistence opposed getting good grades social influences careereconomic opportunities Seymour Hewitt interviewed students left STEM majors college found students frequently cited loss interest STEM fields growing interest fields primary reasons changing plans Similarly Strenta et al found students left science majors agreed statement switched science fields interesting p Demographic differences Research demographic differences STEM attrition shown compared peers African American HispanicLatinoa students well firstgeneration college students ie neither parent fouryear college degree less likely pursue STEM majors initially likely drop STEM fields college Beasley Fisher Chang et al National Science Board Shaw Barbuti Many researchers also studied gender differences STEM attrition eg Cheryan Ziegler Montoya Jiang National Science Board Wang Degol review However gender differences attrition depend particular STEM subfield studied eg physics biology pattern differential attrition

introductory STEM courses part likely arrive college less academic preparation Chang et al Dika DAmico Lower performance introductory courses decrease competencerelated beliefs STEM fields contribute higher rates attrition Moreover evidence suggests URM students struggle perceive value STEM fields Perez trends contribute higher attrition among underrepresented students URM FG students also face unique challenges may affect attrition independently task values competence perceptions Students underrepresented groups may experience identity threat result perceiving negative stereotypes academic

underrepresented groups impair academic performance undermine perceptions belonging STEM fields Beasley Fischer Steele Spencer Aronson Walton Cohen Students Leave Disenchantment STEM Attraction Fields research reviewed identifies several factors may cause students feel disenchantment STEM fields perceiving competent successful given STEM field b perceiving lack value interest STEM courses careers c perceiving sense identity threat STEM classroom work environments important mitigate perceptions indeed growing body intervention research suggests attrition reduced educators conduct interventions address factors see Harackiewicz Priniski Walton Wilson reviews However exclusive focus factors misses fact many students change majors STEM fields dont abandon STEM students intend remain college switch another field Thus students considering switching majors likely think factors make want leave STEM fields ie factors make feel disenchantment factors make want pursue alternative fields ie factors attract towards nonSTEM fields students likely consider features STEM nonSTEM fields deciding change fields study students leave STEM fields likely feel disenchantment STEM well attraction fields However students may differ extent view disenchantment STEM fields versus attraction nonSTEM fields influential decision change plans students may think attrition primarily terms negative perceptions experiences STEM fields led feelings disenchantment students may think attrition primarily terms positive perceptions experiences nonSTEM fields attracted away Still students may think attraction disenchantment factors equal weight differences students think decisions may consequential noted students feel attraction toward nonSTEM field may view attrition STEM positive terms think primarily disenchantment STEM fields Moreover different reasons may implications best support students present study use students explanations changed plans away biomedical fields indicator predominant ways thought attrition fields gain insights regarding different students reflections may distinct one another Eccles argued students deciding academic major career pursue compare values associated different fields study research explored topic empirically examining students compare perceptions value competence STEM fields versus fields deciding whether pursue STEM careers Diekman Brown Johnston Clark Gaspard Wille Wormington Hulleman Lauermann Chow Eccles Ost Wang Eccles Kenny work focused negative side comparisons ie relatively low perceptions value competence relative fields make students less likely pursue STEM studies begun examine comparisons might involve students feeling attracted nonSTEM fields two studies researchers found college students left STEM fields

leaving STEM majors Considered together research suggests depending aspects STEMnonSTEM comparisons salient students students might reflect attrition STEM primarily terms disenchantment STEM fields primarily terms attraction fields combination two Despite initial work studies examined prevalence relative importance disenchantment versus attraction students attrition decisionmaking processes result little known frequently students think leaving STEM fields primarily terms disenchantment versus attraction whether students report leaving primarily due disenchantment differ report leaving

biomedical fields study left fields became disenchanted whether students left felt attracted features nonbiomedical fields Although students leave STEM fields college likely think negative aspects original field study positive aspects new field study deciding major career path results present study demonstrate substantial variability whether students predominantly reflected attrition terms reasons related attraction versus disenchantment Indeed large proportion students left biomedical fields explained attrition terms least positive features attracted towards nonbiomedical field study one quarter students explained attrition exclusively terms attraction factors results highlight importance considering factors may cause students perceive STEM fields negatively also factors might make students perceive fields study positively order obtain nuanced understanding STEM attrition findings consistent growing body research eg Diekman et al Eccles Gaspard et al Ost suggesting students consider aspects STEM nonSTEM majors careers deciding leave STEM fields study also provide evidence kinds attractiondisenchantment tensions discussed prior research Seymour Hewitt Thoman et al results extend prior work examining relative importance students place attraction versus disenchantment explaining attrition decisions examining factors predict distinct types attrition important understand experiences students report leaving due feeling attraction versus disenchantment order provide different students appropriate educational supports Results interviews offer suggestions develop supports Students expressed leaving due attraction almost described perceiving high interest value nonbiomedical majors career paths students referencing interest fit occurred despite students clear initial plans pursue biomedical careers suggesting students cancould drawn towards positive aspects alternative fields even thought initially committed certain career Students emphasis interest enjoyment nonbiomedical fields fit fields suggest intrinsic attainment components students task values may key determinants leaving due fields attraction educators want retain students biomedical fields need focus reducing barriers success within biomedical fields Rather need make positive case biomedical fields emphasizing interesting features fields support students sense identification One option may try support students academic values across different domains simultaneously emphasizing interdisciplinary topics include biomedical material encouraging students pursue biomedical fields study alongside fields eg double major career utilizes biomedical competencies lies within nonbiomedical field Given importance STEM skills STEM nonSTEM careers National Science Board efforts could ensure interested students continue develop important STEM competencies without asking give options identify third possibility educators accept students decisions move fields focus retention efforts students responses students left primarily due attraction also shed light attract undecided nonbiomedical students biomedical majors careers particular students left due attraction expressed enthusiasm interest features nonbiomedical coursework careers contrasts sharply descriptions biomedical fields given students left due disenchantment biomedical fields descriptions often made extant literature introductory lecturebased STEM courses dense boring tedious also see Seymour Hewitt Gasiewski Eagan Garcia Hurtado Chang Presidents Council Advisors Science Technology educators strive make introductory biomedical coursework stimulating engaging might evoke greater enthusiasm undecided nonbiomedical students possibly draw fields towards biomedical fields students expressed leaving biomedical fields primarily due feelings disenchantment half discussed factors made lose interest original major career path perceive valuable eg found coursework boring would enjoy daytoday tasks associated particular career Another students referenced low confidence perceived ability primary factor influencing decisions eg could get medical school students report perceiving positive aspects new field study Educators best support students trying address factors make students perceive STEM coursework boring difficult order help prevent leaving biomedical fields without strong desire pursue alternative field also may useful help students perceive difficulty courses worthwhile positive challenge may help frame negative experiences positive light thus feel less demoralized experiences Finally preemptive measures ensure students informed types coursework pursue en route given major daytoday tasks associated certain careers may help prevent students engaging fields study ultimately lead disappointment Predicting Attrition Feelings Disenchantment Feelings Attraction Another goal study explore factors predicted whether students left biomedical fields primarily due disenchantment attraction Although much prior research examined factors predict attrition STEM fields research distinguished different types attrition examined whether different factors predict two types overall attrition results generally consistent prior research eg Chen Eccles Perez et al Controlling baseline interest prior achievement students earned lower grades introductory biology course students lower interest biology end course significantly likely leave biomedical fields compared remaining fields Also consistent prior research found URM students significantly likely leave biomedical fields majority students Beasley Fisher Chang et al Shaw Barbuti National Science Board Process analyses suggested students higher attrition associated part received lower biology course grades Results highlight critical importance addressing racial ethnic achievement gaps STEM courses route reduce STEM attrition Educators try address goal helping ensure URM students receive appropriate educational supports help succeed introductory college STEM courses Interventions aim promote interest perceptions belonging course performance underrepresented students may particularly helpful regard eg Brown Smith Thoman Allen Muragashi Cohen Garcia Apfel Master Harackiewicz Smith Priniski Walton Cohen Results inconsistent prior research FG status predict attrition models using demographic predictors fact FG students less likely leave due feelings disenchantment models included psychological predictors finding suggests FG students particularly motivated remain biomedical fields reasons beyond achievement interest biology possible FG students major career decisions impacted unique set factors captured current study Stephens Markus Phillips encourage researchers test whether finding replicates contexts study dynamics attrition FG students across different STEM fields future research respect distinct types attrition found many factors predicting overall attrition also predicted students leaving biomedical fields due disenchantment compared remaining fields biology course grades interest biology end semester URM status results consistent interview responses suggesting low interest biomedical subjects low perceptions competence biomedical courses two key factors made students want leave biomedical fields findings underscore conclusions drawn path prevent students perceiving STEM fields negatively educators try help succeed challenging introductory courses particularly URM students may receive lower grades addition trying emphasize interesting features STEM fields study students lives Results predicting students leaving due attraction fields quite different Reporting lower interest end introductory biology course lower course grades associated leaving due attraction compared remaining biomedical fields controlling baseline interest prior achievement However endofsemester interest somewhat stronger predictor relative course grades appears students felt attracted nonbiomedical fields heavily influenced biology course grades students felt disenchantment biomedical fields Given two groups significantly different course performance may students respond poorly low biology course grades become likely think attrition disenchantmentrelated terms relatively higher frequency disenchantment students referencing competence ability interviews supports supposition suggests low grades salient group case students left due attraction unaffected biology course grades students seem somewhat strongly affected factors related interest terms declining interest biomedicine increasing interest another field Interest biology strongest predictor students leaving due attraction regression models contrasts interview responses students group often reference declining interest biology instead often referenced growing interest fields primary determinant plans changing Even attraction disenchantment group provides clearest information students decisionmaking processes respect old new majors less half students stated loss interest biomedical fields caused notice seek positive experiences fields findings suggest perceiving low interest biology relative ones peers may make students susceptible attracted towards alternative fields students might realize low interest played salient role decisions Research grounded expectancyvalue theory reports high school students perceive values hierarchy across subjects students perceive strong value one subject may come devalue subjects fields closely related Eccles Gaspard et al Guo Marsh Parker Morin Dicke Lauermann et al present study may case students began perceive low interest biomedical fields likely perceive higher interest fields time without necessarily aware shift Together findings suggest students experience low interest biology positive interest fit experiences fields particularly likely feel attracted towards nonbiomedical fields also found interaction suggesting effects endofsemester biology interest leaving due attraction versus remaining biomedical fields strongest highestachieving students controlling baseline interest prior achievement surprising low interest may impactful students higher course performance Higherperforming students may feel capable making decisions based comparing interests across different fields relatively successful introductory biology course might assume capable succeeding alternative majors well contrast lowerperforming students may concerned finding field perform well thus might give interests less weight deciding whether change fields study Broadly qualitative quantitative findings point critical importance interest shaping students decisions leaving biomedical fields reason Harackiewicz Smith Priniski Renninger Hidi study students entered biology course interest pursuing biomedical career interest end course proved least strong predictor course performance types attrition High levels endofsemester interest associated remaining field whereas lower levels endofsemester interest associated leaving field Much attention given role poor performance introductory courses predicting attrition eg Chen already discussed critical consider equal importance interest shaping students attrition decisions educators want ensure students continue take STEM courses future perceive STEM fields study positively important ensure course material stimulating students perceive value studying Otherwise risk losing students come course high initial interest choosing opt fields time Conclusions Future Directions recommend researchers build upon findings present study examining attraction disenchantment related reasons leaving broader variety STEM subjects different populations STEM college students believe findings presented generalizable STEM subjects may additional factors consider STEM disciplines example may gender differences reasons attrition STEM fields physics engineering women seriously underrepresented among students faculty work force National Science Foundation fields characterized lack role models lower sense belonging women Walton Logel Peach Spencer Zanna well experiences gender bias peers professors Robnett terms nonSTEM subject areas assume results presented would generalize types major changes eg changing business major humanities major Although individuals likely would consider attraction disenchantment reasons leaving subject areas prevalence different reasons attrition factors predicting types attrition would likely differ across subject areas Similarly present study treated students remained biomedical major career similarly much variability students career pursuits within fields could provide additional insight regarding students change career plans throughout course college Another limitation collected data regarding psychological predictors attrition Future researchers explore role psychological predictors predicting distinct types attrition understand topic particular study utilized course grades prior achievement predictors expectancyvalue theory would suggest students competencerelated beliefs actual competence proximal predictors motivated academic behavior believe grades serve useful indicator competencerelated beliefs future research explore depth whether beliefs predict types attrition ways distinct grades study explored one dimension students reasons attrition STEM fields disenchantment versus attraction Although believe dimension one critical understanding students leave STEM fields also may important dimensions STEM major choices informative whether students felt internal factors shaped decisionmaking eg low confidence whether external interactions experiences influential eg conversations advisor final limitation present study sufficient sample size address questions related intersectionality among demographic variables Students intersecting gender social class racial ethnic identities shape experiences college STEM courses ways understood examining one demographic factor time eg ElseQuest Hyde Harackiewicz et al recommend researchers build upon results reported examining students intersecting identities relate decisions remain leave STEM majors Broadly designed present study shed light attraction disenchantmentrelated dynamics may cause students leave STEM fields results may help educators understand reasons different students leave STEM fields may ultimately help provide effective equitable education Educational Impact Implications Statement study shows students reflect attrition biomedical fields study college distinct ways Results interviews demonstrated many students reported leaving biomedical fields felt disenchanted however students reported leaving biomedical fields least part due feeling attracted positive features nonbiomedical fields biology grades interest affected students likelihood leaving biomedical fields two factors predicted leaving due disenchantment equally strongly whereas interest played stronger role compared grades predicting whether students left due attraction towards fields study points importance considering positive factors associated alternative fields shape students attrition instead focusing negative factors make students feel disenchanted biomedical fields also reinforces prior research

undergraduate education become infectious disease physician However lost interest track premed undergraduate courses taking bored biology chemistry classes students group referenced interest fit related experiences opposed experiences related job rewards opportunities example students referenced courses perceived boring career plans lost interest perceived fit well lack satisfaction andor passion original major career plan Thirty students explained leaving terms reasons related disenchantment referenced confidence ability primary reason changing plans away biomedical fields students often expressed one two reasons changing plans students indicated would unable meet admissions requirements graduate school chosen career example one student wrote career plans changed succeed science courses enough able enter physician assistant school graduating high enough grades core science classes apply students indicated poor performance prerequisite courses STEM major drove away biomedical fields student stated Intro Biology proved weed class struggling wanted teacher always back mind everyone family teachers wanted try different route class huge challenge learned early beginning class meant cases issues interestvalue confidenceability interacted affect students decisions example one student described poor performance outside requirements outweighed initial interest course started premed switched prelaw realized becoming doctor wasnt right plan although enjoy biology courses primarily due poor performance lack interest organic chemistry courses higher level calculus Another student described course difficulty negatively affecting interest plans changed biology classes university name nearly impossible made longer interested pursuing sciencerelated degree Finally students indicated left primarily costs barriers associated biomedical majors career paths students either reported external barriers made biomedical degree seem much challenging eg death family articulated believe time cost psychological toll pursuing particular biomedical career worth example one student wrote plans changed didnt want spend many years school going medical school Another student expressed Medical school Thats really need say Although love sciences desire help Latinos underrepresented groups community still huge part certain point could mentally go Students left due attraction students discussed leaving due feeling attraction towards nonbiomedical fields responses almost interest value new majors career paths n students discussed attraction reasons leaving two students responses vague classify students coursework attracted away biomedical field One student wrote used want go medical field mainly physicians assistant However taking Intro Sociology concurrently Intro Biology fell love Sociology decided major Another student stated plans changed discovered passion creative writing students positive aspects various career paths drew away One student wrote planning applying medical school gained experience psychology field direct patient care changed focus toward obtaining PhD Similar students expressed disenchantment vast majority students expressed leaving due attraction discussed change terms interest fitrelated experiences rather job rewards opportunities majority students attraction group articulated point baseline follow clear initial career plans However small subgroup students n expressed somewhat undecided initial career plans prior feeling attracted nonbiomedical fields students stated either weak commitment initial profession eg took Intro Bio course prerequisite optometry school similar medical degree keep options open complete lack commitment initial career plans despite reported interest biomedical major baseline time point eg figured going time students initial uncertainty career plans may made open perceiving attractive features alternative fields Students left due disenchantment attraction Among students expressed disenchantment attraction factors explanations left biomedical fields students referenced topics related interest value Similar groups students often discussed interest fitrelated experiences opposed experiences related job rewards opportunities particular many students referenced loss interest biomedical field growing interest another major career path example one student stated interested psychology research becoming doctor specifically psychiatrist found losing interest two things longterm career paths Meanwhile business certificate required take economics courses found intrigued realized order able economic research would need much stronger background mathematics statistics Finding particularly interested forecasting prediction decided statistics way go really love Among students referencing interest value wide variation order students reported experiencing disenchantment versus attraction case students first experienced disenchantment attraction Five students reported loss interest perceived fit initial field study caused search alternative options point considered positive aspects alternative fields example one student expressed completing biology organic chemistry decided med school decided pursue interest counseling psychology However two students expressed positive experiences new field study drove realize dissatisfied original majors career plans Additionally four students described change plans simultaneous stating point decided interests better aligned one field study versus another example one student stated decided longer interested sciences much used realized really loved serving people various avenues relationships Finally four students group noted experiences related confidence ability central reason behind change plans Three students quotations stated low perceptions competence low ability primary determinant plans changing point discovered another field liked example one student originally intended major biology wrote Chemistry difficult major reason switched ended taking social work class loved student reported poorer performance expected biology coursework simultaneously discovered growing interest public health

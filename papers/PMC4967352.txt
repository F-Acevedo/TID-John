Discussion complete surgical resection remains treatment modality choice ACC risk recurrence surgery significant many patients experiencing recurrence fact ACC often manifests advanced stage year OS remains guarded ranging However survival surgery ACC vary widely depending tumor stage reflecting prognostic heterogeneity associated disease Accurate prognostication surgery ACC important select patients adjuvant treatment also inform patients accurately longterm prognosis AJCCUICC ENSAT staging systems commonly used predicting outcomes prognostic factors reported associated longterm survival varied optimal method risk stratification patients ACC unclear study created nomograms numerically predicted individuals RFS OS surgical resection ACC based patientrelated tumorrelated factors information used inform prognosis patients well make individualized decisions regarding treatment surveillance present study important nomograms developed using large multiinstitutional group patients underwent surgery ACC addition contrast previously proposed nomogram based Surveillance Epidemiology End Results program database performance present nomograms rigorously assessed internally validated Another particular strength present study took account wide array variables previously reported associated prognosis surgical resection ACC Factors reported associated outcomes varied widely relative lack consensus regarding factors key determining prognosis example studies reported age sex high tumor grade hormonesecreting tumors tumor size associated worse outcomes studies demonstrated association cortisolsecreting ACC tumors poor outcome contrast researchers reported correlation age sex tumor size functionality tumor longterm survival present study similarly noted association sex age functionality tumor RFS OS Table Table contrast data ACC demonstrated completeness surgery ie R vs R tumor stage diagnosis consistently associated worse prognosis Indeed also noted factors strongly linked outcomes risk death fold higher among patients R margin risk recurrence fold higher among patients stage IIIIV disease knowledge present study first risk stratification model consider previously proposed risk variables assess independently inclusion formal nomograms ACC prognosis Accurate risk stratification patients tumors ACC important prognosis patients may heterogeneous Instead using staging information AJCCUICC ENSAT classification derived based populationbased large cohort data nomograms may provide individualized manner provide prognostic information patients Zini et al previously proposed nomogram among patients ACC incorporated age tumor stage model indicating distant metastasis potent predictive factor mortality inclusion patients metastasis problematic particularly helpful selfevident distant disease largely drives prognosis chose limit analytic cohort patients evidence metastatic disease provide prognostic information patients likely undergoing surgical management ACC ie classified Indeed stratified tertiles proposed nomograms able identify distinct groups patients different risks recurrence death Figure important proposed nomograms demonstrated good discriminative ability C statistic predicting RFS C statistic predicting OS Figure addition median year survival predicted nomograms similar actual survival calculated KaplanMeier curves Collectively data strongly suggest proposed nomograms provide patientspecific information risk recurrence survival patients ACC surgery Accurate data prognosis patients ACC may important treating physicians several reasons role adjuvant chemotherapy radiation therapy ACC treatment extensively studied relative rarity disease studies reported adjuvant systemic mitotane therapy may provide RFS OS benefit select patients localized disease patients received adjuvant mitotane individualized risk prediction models present nomograms may role selecting guiding postoperative treatment future present study several limitations Despite combining experience large health care centers sample size still small analyses may limited addition data certain factors nuclear grade mitotic index unavailable therefore effect potential incorporation nomograms could assessed collaborating multiple institutions undoubtedly led lack standard diagnostic treatment approaches multicenter nature present study also strength improves generalizability findings Finally although nomograms internally validated using bootstrap validation future studies needed externally validate proposed nomograms Conclusions Using large multicenter data set patients underwent resection ACC several independent prognostic variables identified predict RFS OS proposed nomograms able stratify patients distinct prognostic groups regarding recurrence overall longterm outcomes addition nomograms performed well internal validation Future studies needed externally validate proposed nomograms establish value

significant many patients experiencing recurrence fact ACC often manifests advanced stage year OS remains guarded ranging However survival surgery ACC vary widely depending tumor stage reflecting prognostic heterogeneity associated disease Accurate prognostication surgery ACC important select patients adjuvant treatment also inform patients accurately longterm prognosis AJCCUICC ENSAT staging systems commonly used predicting outcomes prognostic factors reported associated longterm survival varied optimal method risk stratification patients ACC unclear study created nomograms numerically

surveillance present study important nomograms developed using large multiinstitutional group patients underwent surgery ACC addition contrast previously proposed nomogram based Surveillance Epidemiology End Results program database performance present nomograms rigorously assessed internally validated Another particular strength present study took account wide array variables previously reported associated prognosis surgical resection ACC Factors reported associated outcomes varied widely relative lack consensus regarding factors key determining prognosis example studies reported age sex high tumor grade hormonesecreting tumors tumor size associated worse outcomes studies demonstrated association cortisolsecreting ACC tumors poor outcome contrast researchers reported correlation

risk stratification patients tumors ACC important prognosis patients may heterogeneous Instead using staging information AJCCUICC ENSAT classification derived based populationbased large cohort data nomograms may provide individualized manner provide prognostic information patients Zini et al previously proposed nomogram among patients ACC incorporated age tumor stage model indicating distant metastasis potent predictive factor mortality inclusion patients metastasis problematic particularly helpful selfevident distant disease largely drives prognosis chose limit analytic cohort patients evidence metastatic disease provide prognostic information patients likely undergoing surgical management ACC ie classified Indeed stratified tertiles proposed nomograms able identify distinct groups patients different risks recurrence death Figure important proposed nomograms demonstrated good discriminative ability C statistic predicting RFS C statistic predicting OS Figure addition median year survival predicted nomograms similar actual survival calculated KaplanMeier curves Collectively data strongly suggest proposed nomograms provide patientspecific information risk recurrence survival patients ACC surgery Accurate data prognosis patients ACC may important treating physicians several reasons role adjuvant chemotherapy radiation therapy ACC treatment extensively studied relative rarity disease studies reported adjuvant systemic mitotane therapy may provide RFS OS benefit select patients localized disease patients received adjuvant mitotane individualized risk prediction models present nomograms may role selecting guiding postoperative treatment future present study several limitations Despite combining experience large health care centers sample size still small analyses may limited addition data certain factors nuclear grade mitotic index unavailable therefore effect potential incorporation nomograms could assessed collaborating multiple institutions undoubtedly led lack standard diagnostic treatment approaches multicenter nature present study also strength improves generalizability findings Finally although nomograms internally validated using bootstrap validation future studies needed externally validate proposed nomograms Conclusions Using large multicenter data set patients underwent resection ACC several independent prognostic variables identified predict RFS OS proposed nomograms able stratify patients distinct prognostic groups regarding recurrence overall longterm outcomes addition nomograms performed well internal validation

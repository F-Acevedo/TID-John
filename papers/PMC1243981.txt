many systematic orders Additional research needed determine whether would maximize immediate emergence linked perceptual classes testing orders maximize yields others differences testing orders might well clarify behavioral processes responsible emergence linked perceptual classes Generalization effects test schedules Primary generalization probably played significant role differential effects test schedules emergence linked perceptual classes PRGM schedule could maximized emergence classes generalization following manner first three test blocks ie aa ba probes differed minimally previous crossclass probe value adjacent sample stimulus eg anchor midpoint boundary Small albeit discriminable differences stimulus value maximize likelihood generalization stimuli Thus PRGM test small changes stimulus value across successive test blocks likely maximize generalization classbased performances test block next addition comparisons used first three test blocks discriminable stimuli classes ie anchor stimuli thereby maximizing likelihood emitting classbased performances Finally comparison sets used successive sets three tests blocks differed incrementally one block cluster next likely maximized generalization classbased performances comparisons combined effects scheduledetermined operations generalization maximized emergence linked perceptual classes PRGM testing schedule three testing schedules used many different crossclass probes introduced randomized sequence block procedure increased disparity stimuli presented adjacent trials necessity reduced effects generalization classconsistent comparison selection across test trials consequently reduced likelihood linked perceptual class formation Probe types per block linked perceptual class formation results prior research suggested likelihood linked perceptual class formation inverse function number different types crossclass probes included test block current experiment however modest yields obtained ninefold variation number different probe types presented test block nine probes per block one probe per block Clearly number different probe types test block variable determinant linked perceptual class formation modest yields obtained test blocks contained nine three one probe type per test block suggests yields determined factor constant across test conditions One factor randomized presentation trials different probe types occurred within test blocks tests across test blocks RND test Therefore plausible conclude randomized presentation trials different probe types responsible constancy yields across testing schedules Nonemergence linked perceptual classes test schedules failures class formation occurred breakdown previously established crossclass conditional discriminations symmetrical counterparts Furthermore breakdowns occurred probes consisted boundary rather anchor stimuli suggests stimuli perceptual class equally related Perhaps linked perceptual

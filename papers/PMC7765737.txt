CEP measurement could eventually allow clinicians identify mildtomoderately degenerated Pfirrmann grade II III discs deficits CEP composition may contributing factor Mean values highest centrally

previous studies wherein CEP tissues sampled manually discretely assessment provides noninvasive systematic continuous picture spatial variations CEP composition enables robust subregional comparisons Another interesting finding values demonstrated greater variation central subregion posterior subregion could indicate greater compositional variation central subregion CEP However could also reflect partial volume effects central subregion known thinnest region Histologic measurements indicate mean CEP thickness mm inplane voxel size mm smaller reported mean CEP thickness segmented CEP masks voxels thick voxels average may partial volume averaging boney endplate NP affects interquartile range locations Nevertheless believe partial volume effects likely small impact mean values since prior

Specifically disc degeneration associated deficits CEP composition permeability earlier stages disc degeneration increased disc degeneration thought proceed reduced transport results corroborate prior findings since low CEP values correlate lower water content greater collagen content tissue characteristics impact CEP transport properties Specifically lower water content prevents solutes diffusing

orientation LS CEPs near magic angle owing lumbar lordosis help accentuate lordotic curve angle CEPs closely magic angle placed inchthick foam pillow lumbar spine Also restricted analysis CEPs caudal discs Cranial CEPs generally lower contrast adjacent tissues caudal CEPs thus making accurate segmentation difficult Since caudal CEPs less permeable cranial CEPs caudal CEPs may likely limit nutrient transport could thus play greater role adjacent disc degeneration said findings apply caudal CEPs factors including composition cranial CEP permeability bony endplate may contribute independentlyAn important limitation study relatively small number discs results interpreted carefully overgeneralized Based age group largest observed variance mean SD ms power minimum detectable difference mean ms amount variation Twhether due natural biologic heterogeneity noise MRI measurementmay necessitate larger sample sizes subtle differences groups detected Related correlation NP CEP values Pfirrmann grade II III discs suggests CEP composition relevant factor validated larger studies second limitation histologic biochemical validation MRI findings possible However prior studies reported significant correlations values NP GAG content values CEP biochemical composition Additionally MRI findings consistent known changes NP CEP biochemical composition age supports validity findings third limitation mapping sequences used subjects cadavers different echo times spinlock times However since echo times spinlock times two sequences spanned similar ranges unlikely differences affected results Related pooled vivo ex vivo MRI data achieve broad age disc degeneration range subtle changes MRI characteristics may occur postmortem effects appear small comparison effects age disc degeneration example mean NP values cadavers study age years years ms similar mean NP values measured vivo previously age years years ms Also certain exclusion criteria could independently impact disc health including diabetes positive smoking status applied cadavers may therefore contributed unexplained variability findings fourth limitation tested shortterm vivo repeatability seven subjects precludes accurate estimation confidence interval around precision errors scans conducted morning reduce confounding effects diurnal variations disc water content thus repeatability course daily

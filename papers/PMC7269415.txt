neural processes However also present massive multiple comparisons problem potentially leading large number studies false positive effects high Type error rate Standard approaches ERP statistical

viewed appropriate primarily exploratory statistical analysis applicable simple designs present new simulation studies showing permutationbased mass univariate tests employed complex factorial designs importantly show mass univariate approaches provide slightly greater power traditional spatiotemporal averaging approaches strong priori time windows spatial regions used Moreover power decreases modestly exploratory spatiotemporal parameters used argue mass univariate approaches preferable traditional spatiotemporal averaging analysis approaches many ERP studies Keywords eventrelated

replicate findings Assuming exact methodological replication including sampling population inability replicate results problem inferential error means one studies either original replication reached wrong conclusion replication failures common means procedures making statistical inference flawed regularly producing either Type errors false positives incorrectly concluding effect exists Type II errors false negatives incorrectly concluding effect exist fact reasons believe kinds errors common lot discussion replication failure focused researcher degrees freedom Simmons Nelson Simonsohn impact Type error rate Research psychology neuroscience often involves collecting multiple multidimensional independent variables dependent variables Even relatively simple designs often many potential ways process analyze data several effects calculated study due multiple independent variables andor dependent variables data analyzed multiple different ways provides multiple chances find effect Since analyses independent partially independent error rate probability least one test analysis path give significant effect appear provide support hypothesiseven true effectmay significantly higher nominal Type error rate many cases multiple comparisons problem raised complex designs analysis flexibility hidden implicit therefore always obvious probability false positive greatly inflated Cramer et al Gelman Loken Kriegeskorte Simmons Bellgowan Baker Luck Gaspelin Vul Harris Winkielman Pashler many authors argued significant factor contributing false positive effects literature John Loewenstein Prelec Masicampo Lalande Simmons et al discuss problem may particularly prominent ERP research second factor contributing low replicability low power high Type II error rate course every researcher wants high power want spend time resources takes conduct study miss real effects However less often appreciated high power also crucial producing replicable effectsthat power plays role statistical inference fail find effects also observe significant results two reasons First conduct study power may well find significant effect However attempt replicate result equally likely able show effect conclude result trust statistician R Fishers words may say phenomenon experimentally demonstrable know conduct experiment rarely fail give us statistically significant result p long run draw important conclusions single study number studies Unless conduct research consistently high power literature always provide weak andor contradictory evidence second reason power important producing replicable effects influences false discovery rate proportion significant results false positives common misconception set significant results false positives often mistakenly inferred result significant chance error Greenland et al Haller Krauss However rate null rejected across studies null true therefore serves upper bound false positive rate across studies conducted longrun proportion false positives among subset studies produce significant results generally much higher proportion called false discovery rate function Type error rate also power see difference imagine conduct hypothesis tests One hundred cases null true Type error rate properly controlled cases alternative hypothesis true ie true effect power detect effect would expect find significant effects cases null true cases alternative true Thus significant effects false positives even though Type error rate appropriately controlled studies conducted result false positives example obvious power higher false discovery rate lower Especially combined publication bias tendency publish statistically significant results high false discovery rate lead literature highly misleading full false positives Thus low power undermines confidence significant effects real discussion see Button et al Colquhoun Unfortunately due noisy measures relatively expensive terms time money data collection low powered studies probably norm cognitive neuroscience Button et al summarize null hypothesis test effectively discriminates real effects due sampling error Type Type II error rates low hand high actually possible majority significant results obtained false positives basis John Ioannidiss famous claim published research findings false Ioannidis therefore crucial address analysis flexibility properly control Type error rate also expense significantly reducing power Challenges analyzing ERP data EEG researchers along fMRI MEG researchers face additional statistical challenges beyond faced behavioral researchers collect thousands measurements experimental condition necessary consequence studying something complex neural activity Moreover technology improves new analysis approaches

Ebersole DeHaven Mellor confident reported p values accurate error rates tests appropriately controlled given course assumptions test hold problem approach overly rigid potentially dramatically reduce power detect effects time window spatial region chosen priori coincide effect interest experimenter unable detect true effect Importantly situation norm many ERP effects variable timing andor scalp

Federmeier Laszlo vary scalp distribution depending precise nature stimuli Holcomb Kounios Anderson West Kutas Federmeier Moreover even identical stimuli used may differences studies precise scalp

spatiotemporally averaged ERP data dependent variable Unfortunately however discuss next practices reintroduce problems Type error first way researchers increase flexibility analysis select analysis parameters based visualization data remains fairly common practice discussed extensively Luck Gaspelin introduces significant bias Choosing time window andor spatial ROI based differences observed data essentially equivalent conducting analysis many different time windows regions reporting one produces largest effect Framed way multiple comparisons problem inflation Type error rate obvious many possible analyses actually conducted often called problem implicit multiple comparisons Luck Gaspelin see also Gelman Loken many researchers appear unaware extent inflate Type error rate undermine confidence significant results second way researchers attempted increase flexibility analysis principled nature either spatial regions andor temporal window included additional factors statistical model example electrodes may divided different spatial regions entered repeated measures ANOVA hemisphere factor anteriorposterior factor possible examine main effects experimental conditions interest interaction effects spatial factors approach advantage eliminating need choose spatial region priori discuss next however approach introduces new multiple comparisons problem understand interpret interaction spatial factor type ANOVA important understand biophysical basis EEGERP detailed explanation see Buzski Anastassiou Koch Luck postsynaptic potentials generate ERPs create electrical dipoles generate positive voltage one side particular region cortex corresponding negative voltage side electrode montage scalp covers approximately half full sphere Thus dipole oriented vertically one side recorded electrodes scalp record voltage direction dipole oriented horizontally sides recorded component appear positive deflection sites negative deflection others either case neural source project different weights different electrodes Thus effects composed single dipole composed multiple additive dipoles yield interaction experimental condition electroderegion Moreover since positive negative ends dipole never cancel perfectly across recorded electrodes effects also generate main effect Whether main effect andor interaction effect detected reaches statistical significance simply combination dipole orientation strength discussion interpretation interactions see Luck McCarthy Wood Urbach Kutas Thus inclusion spatial factor ANOVA model gives every effect two independent chances reaching significance multiple spatial factors included problem increases exponentially eg two spatial factors every effect four chances reach significance leads significant inflation Type error rate Although quite common researchers attempt increase flexibility analyses temporal domain measuring multiple time windows including time window factor single repeated measures ANOVA raises similar multiple comparisons concerns addition approach likely low power effects exist one many time windows tested sum face catch analyzing ERP data consistently high power detect effects across space time

FECAEBCABBEBD Abstract Eventrelated potential ERP studies produce large spatiotemporal datasets rich datasets key enabling us understand cognitive neural processes However also present massive multiple comparisons problem potentially leading large number studies false positive effects high Type error rate Standard approaches ERP statistical analysis average time windows regions interest always control Type error inflexibility lead low power detect true effects Mass univariate approaches offer alternative analytic method However thus far viewed appropriate primarily exploratory statistical analysis applicable simple designs present new simulation studies showing permutationbased mass univariate tests employed complex factorial designs importantly show mass univariate approaches provide slightly greater power traditional spatiotemporal averaging approaches strong priori time windows spatial regions used Moreover power decreases modestly exploratory spatiotemporal parameters used argue mass univariate approaches preferable traditional spatiotemporal averaging analysis approaches many ERP studies Keywords eventrelated potentials ERP EEG statistics mass univariate power replicability multiple comparisons Introduction recent years become increasingly clear many reported results psychology neuroscience unreliable replicate eg Camerer et al Open Science Collaboration Pashler Wagenmakers generated lot discussion reflection methods statistics publication practices career incentives argue key factors lead low replicability magnified EEG ERP research particular large datasets generated EEG research present opportunities flexibility analysis sufficiently addressed current practices field paper discuss issues analysis ERP data undermine ability draw strong conclusions contribute spurious effects literature propose mass univariate analysisan approach often viewed appropriate exploratory analysis ERP researchoffers improvement traditional spatiotemporal averaging approaches regard many issues present new software implement mass univariate analyses factorial designs well simulation studies showing tests provide greater power greater flexibility traditional analysis approaches appropriately maintaining Type error rate Replicability function Type error rate power many potential reasons failure replicate findings Assuming exact methodological replication including sampling population inability replicate results problem inferential error means one studies either original replication reached wrong conclusion replication failures common means procedures making statistical inference flawed regularly producing either Type errors false positives incorrectly concluding effect exists Type II errors false negatives incorrectly concluding effect exist fact reasons believe kinds errors common lot discussion replication failure focused researcher degrees freedom Simmons Nelson Simonsohn impact Type error rate Research psychology neuroscience often involves collecting multiple multidimensional independent variables dependent variables Even relatively simple designs often many potential ways process analyze data several effects calculated study due multiple independent variables andor dependent variables data analyzed multiple different ways provides multiple chances find effect Since analyses independent partially independent error rate probability least one test analysis path give significant effect appear provide support hypothesiseven true effectmay significantly higher nominal Type error rate many cases multiple comparisons problem raised complex designs analysis flexibility hidden implicit therefore always obvious probability false positive greatly inflated Cramer et al Gelman Loken Kriegeskorte Simmons Bellgowan Baker Luck Gaspelin Vul Harris Winkielman Pashler many authors argued significant factor contributing false positive effects literature John Loewenstein Prelec Masicampo Lalande Simmons et al discuss problem may particularly prominent ERP research second factor contributing low replicability low power high Type II error rate course every researcher wants high power want spend time resources takes conduct study miss real effects However less often appreciated high power also crucial producing replicable effectsthat power plays role statistical inference fail find effects also observe significant results two reasons First conduct study power may well find significant effect However attempt replicate result equally likely able show effect conclude result trust statistician R Fishers words may say phenomenon experimentally demonstrable know conduct experiment rarely fail give us statistically significant result p long run draw important conclusions single study number studies Unless conduct research consistently high power literature always provide weak andor contradictory evidence second reason power important producing replicable effects influences false discovery rate proportion significant results false positives common misconception set significant results false positives often mistakenly inferred result significant chance error Greenland et al Haller Krauss However rate null rejected across studies null true therefore serves upper bound false positive rate across studies conducted longrun proportion false positives among subset studies produce significant results generally much higher proportion called false discovery rate function Type error rate also power see difference imagine conduct hypothesis tests One hundred cases null true Type error rate properly controlled cases alternative hypothesis true ie true effect power detect effect would expect find significant effects cases null true cases alternative true Thus significant effects false positives even though Type error rate appropriately controlled studies conducted result false positives example obvious power higher false discovery rate lower Especially combined publication bias tendency publish statistically significant results high false discovery rate lead literature highly misleading full false positives Thus low power undermines confidence significant effects real discussion see Button et al Colquhoun Unfortunately due noisy measures relatively expensive terms time money data collection low powered studies probably norm cognitive neuroscience Button et al summarize null hypothesis test effectively discriminates real effects due sampling error Type Type II error rates low hand high actually possible majority significant results obtained false positives basis John Ioannidiss famous claim published research findings false Ioannidis therefore crucial address analysis flexibility properly control Type error rate also expense significantly reducing power Challenges analyzing ERP data EEG researchers along fMRI MEG researchers face additional statistical challenges beyond faced behavioral researchers collect thousands measurements experimental condition necessary consequence studying something complex neural activity Moreover technology improves new analysis approaches developed researchers collecting even larger multidimensional datasets However flexibility choose analyze large amount data significantly increase Type error rate Consider simple ERP experiment measurements recorded

Gaspelin briefly describe see also Kilner Kriegeskorte et al Luck Chapter Traditional approaches ERP analysis Spatiotemporal averaging common way handle large amount data collected ERP study reduce via spatiotemporal averaging prior statistical analysis time domain effect measured calculating maximum minimum value peak amplitude average value mean amplitude across particular time window Luck Chapters spatial domain data reduced choosing representative electrode averaging across subset electrodes selected reflect typical spatial distribution effect interest example ERP researcher may operationalize N component mean amplitude ms averaged across spatial region centroparietal electrodes eg Cz CP CPz CP Pz approach Type error rate controlled eliminating researcher degrees freedom altogether fully specifying priori spatial region time widow interest Particularly procedures preregistered Chambers Feredoes Muthukumaraswamy Etchells Lindsay Simons Lilienfeld Nosek Ebersole DeHaven Mellor confident reported p values accurate error rates tests appropriately controlled given course assumptions test hold problem approach overly rigid potentially dramatically reduce power detect effects time window spatial region chosen priori coincide effect interest experimenter unable detect true effect Importantly situation norm many ERP effects variable timing andor scalp distribution

vary scalp distribution depending precise nature stimuli Holcomb Kounios Anderson West Kutas Federmeier Moreover even identical stimuli used may differences studies precise scalp distribution effect differences individuals populations precise neuroanatomical sources activated structural functional neuroanatomy leading different projections sources scalp surface Thus even researcher wellmotivated clear priori hypothesis wellstudied component amplitude modulated may know advance exact time window spatial ROI best characterize component studies researcher little priori prediction andor effect manifest mean amplitude approach may restrictive make useful analysis impossible Many researchers recognize issue adopted two main methods increasing flexibility still using spatiotemporally averaged ERP data dependent variable Unfortunately however discuss next practices reintroduce problems Type error first way researchers increase flexibility analysis select analysis parameters based visualization data remains fairly common practice discussed extensively Luck Gaspelin introduces significant bias Choosing time window andor spatial ROI based differences observed data essentially equivalent conducting analysis many different time windows regions reporting one produces largest effect Framed way multiple comparisons problem inflation Type error rate obvious many possible analyses actually conducted often called problem implicit multiple comparisons Luck Gaspelin see also Gelman Loken many researchers appear unaware extent inflate Type error rate undermine confidence significant results second way researchers attempted increase flexibility analysis principled nature either spatial regions andor temporal window included additional factors statistical model example electrodes may divided different spatial regions entered repeated measures ANOVA hemisphere factor anteriorposterior factor possible examine main effects experimental conditions interest interaction effects spatial factors approach advantage eliminating need choose spatial region priori discuss next however approach introduces new multiple comparisons problem understand interpret interaction spatial factor type ANOVA important understand biophysical basis EEGERP detailed explanation see Buzski Anastassiou Koch Luck postsynaptic potentials generate ERPs create electrical dipoles generate positive voltage one side particular region cortex corresponding negative voltage side electrode montage scalp covers approximately half full sphere Thus dipole oriented vertically one side recorded electrodes scalp record voltage direction dipole oriented horizontally sides recorded component appear positive deflection sites negative deflection others either case neural source project different weights different electrodes Thus effects composed single dipole composed multiple additive dipoles yield interaction experimental condition electroderegion Moreover since positive negative ends dipole never cancel perfectly across recorded electrodes effects also generate main effect Whether main effect andor interaction effect detected reaches statistical significance simply combination dipole orientation strength discussion interpretation interactions see Luck McCarthy Wood Urbach Kutas Thus inclusion spatial factor ANOVA model gives every effect two independent chances reaching significance multiple spatial factors included problem increases exponentially eg two spatial factors every effect four chances reach significance leads significant inflation Type error rate Although quite common researchers attempt increase flexibility analyses temporal domain measuring multiple time windows including time window factor single repeated measures ANOVA raises similar multiple comparisons concerns addition approach likely low power effects exist one many time windows tested sum face catch analyzing ERP data consistently high power detect effects across space time require flexibility analysis approaches Yet common approaches ERP research allow much flexibility without increasing Type error rate result much damned damned dont aspect choosing time windows spatial regions ERP analysis several methods proposed deal dilemma within traditional spatiotemporal averaging approach Brooks Zoumpoulaki Bowman Luck Gaspelin none wholly satisfactory situations Mass univariate

approaches appropriately maintaining Type error rate Replicability function Type error rate power many potential reasons failure replicate findings Assuming exact methodological replication including

conduct study miss real effects However less often appreciated high power also crucial producing replicable effectsthat power plays role statistical inference fail find effects also observe significant results two reasons First conduct study power may well find significant effect However attempt replicate result equally likely able show effect conclude result trust statistician R Fishers words may say phenomenon experimentally demonstrable know conduct experiment rarely fail give us statistically significant result p long run draw important conclusions single study number studies Unless conduct research consistently high power literature always provide weak andor contradictory evidence second reason power important producing replicable effects influences false discovery rate proportion significant results false positives common misconception set significant results false positives often mistakenly inferred result significant chance error Greenland et al Haller Krauss However rate null rejected across studies null true therefore serves upper bound false positive rate across studies conducted longrun proportion false positives among subset studies produce significant results generally much higher proportion called false discovery rate function Type error rate also power see difference imagine conduct hypothesis tests One hundred cases null true Type error rate properly controlled cases alternative hypothesis true ie true effect power detect effect would expect find significant effects cases null true cases alternative true Thus significant

publication bias tendency publish statistically significant results high false discovery rate lead literature highly misleading full false positives Thus low power undermines confidence significant

Eventrelated potential ERP studies produce large spatiotemporal datasets rich datasets key enabling us understand cognitive neural processes However also present massive multiple comparisons problem potentially leading large number studies false positive effects high Type error rate Standard approaches ERP statistical analysis average time windows regions interest always control Type error inflexibility lead low power detect true effects Mass univariate approaches offer alternative analytic method However thus far viewed appropriate primarily exploratory statistical analysis applicable simple designs present new simulation studies showing permutationbased mass univariate tests employed complex factorial designs importantly show mass univariate approaches provide slightly greater power traditional spatiotemporal averaging approaches strong priori time windows spatial regions used Moreover power decreases modestly exploratory spatiotemporal parameters used argue mass univariate approaches preferable traditional spatiotemporal averaging analysis approaches many ERP studies Keywords eventrelated potentials ERP EEG statistics mass univariate power replicability multiple comparisons Introduction recent years become increasingly clear many reported results psychology neuroscience unreliable replicate eg Camerer et al Open Science Collaboration Pashler Wagenmakers generated lot discussion reflection methods statistics publication practices career incentives argue key factors lead low replicability magnified EEG ERP research particular large datasets generated EEG research present opportunities flexibility analysis sufficiently addressed current practices field paper discuss issues analysis ERP data undermine ability draw strong conclusions contribute spurious effects literature propose mass univariate analysisan approach often viewed appropriate exploratory analysis ERP researchoffers improvement traditional spatiotemporal averaging approaches regard many issues present new software implement mass univariate analyses factorial designs well simulation studies showing tests provide greater power greater flexibility traditional analysis approaches appropriately maintaining Type error rate Replicability function Type error rate power many potential reasons failure replicate findings Assuming exact methodological replication including sampling population inability replicate results problem inferential error means one studies either original replication reached wrong conclusion replication failures common means procedures making statistical inference flawed regularly producing either Type errors false positives incorrectly concluding effect exists Type II errors false negatives incorrectly concluding effect exist fact reasons believe kinds errors common lot discussion replication failure focused researcher degrees freedom Simmons Nelson Simonsohn impact Type error rate Research psychology neuroscience often involves collecting multiple multidimensional independent variables dependent variables Even relatively simple designs often many potential ways process analyze data several effects calculated study due multiple independent variables andor dependent variables data analyzed multiple different ways provides multiple chances find effect Since analyses independent partially independent error rate probability least one test analysis path give significant effect appear provide support hypothesiseven true effectmay significantly higher nominal Type error rate many cases multiple comparisons problem raised complex designs analysis flexibility hidden implicit therefore always obvious probability false positive greatly inflated Cramer et al Gelman Loken Kriegeskorte Simmons Bellgowan Baker Luck Gaspelin Vul Harris Winkielman Pashler many authors argued significant factor contributing false positive effects literature John Loewenstein Prelec Masicampo Lalande Simmons et al discuss problem may particularly prominent ERP research second factor contributing low replicability low power high Type II error rate course every researcher wants high power want spend time resources takes conduct study miss real effects However less often appreciated high power also crucial producing replicable effectsthat power plays role statistical inference fail find effects also observe significant results two reasons First conduct study power may well find significant effect However attempt replicate result equally likely able show effect conclude result trust statistician R Fishers words may say phenomenon experimentally demonstrable know conduct experiment rarely fail give us statistically significant result p long run draw important conclusions single study number studies Unless conduct research consistently high power literature always provide weak andor contradictory evidence second reason power important producing replicable effects influences false discovery rate proportion significant results false positives common misconception set significant results false positives often mistakenly inferred result significant chance error Greenland et al Haller Krauss However rate null rejected across studies null true therefore serves upper bound false positive rate across studies conducted longrun proportion false positives among subset studies produce significant results generally much higher proportion called false discovery rate function Type error rate also power see difference imagine conduct hypothesis tests One hundred cases null true Type error rate properly controlled cases alternative hypothesis true ie true effect power detect effect would expect find significant effects cases null true cases alternative true Thus significant effects false positives even though Type error rate appropriately controlled studies conducted result false positives example obvious power higher false discovery rate lower Especially combined publication bias tendency publish statistically significant results high false discovery rate lead literature highly misleading full false positives Thus low power undermines confidence significant effects real discussion see Button et al Colquhoun Unfortunately due noisy measures relatively expensive terms time money data collection low powered studies probably norm cognitive neuroscience Button et al summarize null hypothesis test effectively discriminates real effects due sampling error Type Type II error rates low hand high actually possible majority significant results obtained false positives basis John Ioannidiss famous claim published research findings false Ioannidis therefore crucial address analysis flexibility properly control Type error rate also expense significantly reducing power Challenges analyzing ERP data EEG researchers along fMRI MEG researchers face additional statistical challenges beyond faced behavioral researchers collect thousands measurements experimental condition necessary consequence studying something complex neural activity Moreover technology improves new analysis approaches developed researchers collecting even larger multidimensional datasets However flexibility choose analyze large amount data significantly increase Type error rate Consider simple ERP experiment measurements recorded electrodes sampling rate Hz Epochs extending ms stimulus onset extracted data Even individual trials averaged data points subject experimental condition presents massive multiple comparisons problem experiment almost guaranteed time window point scalp effect reaches significance conventional analysis even null hypothesis true time points electrodes follows presence effect reaches statistical significance evidence true effect exists multiple comparisons issue appropriately addressed Unfortunately common ways analyzing ERP data sufficiently address problem issue reviewed detail Luck Gaspelin briefly describe see also Kilner Kriegeskorte et al Luck Chapter Traditional approaches ERP analysis Spatiotemporal averaging common way handle large amount data collected ERP study reduce via spatiotemporal averaging prior statistical analysis time domain effect measured calculating maximum minimum value peak amplitude average value mean amplitude across particular time window Luck Chapters spatial domain data reduced choosing representative electrode averaging across subset electrodes selected reflect typical spatial distribution effect interest example ERP researcher may operationalize N component mean amplitude ms averaged across spatial region centroparietal electrodes eg Cz CP CPz CP Pz approach Type error rate controlled eliminating researcher degrees freedom altogether fully specifying priori spatial region time widow interest Particularly procedures preregistered Chambers Feredoes Muthukumaraswamy Etchells Lindsay Simons Lilienfeld Nosek Ebersole DeHaven Mellor confident reported p values accurate error rates tests appropriately controlled given course assumptions test hold problem approach overly rigid potentially dramatically reduce power detect effects time window spatial region chosen priori coincide effect interest experimenter unable detect true effect Importantly situation norm many ERP effects variable timing andor scalp distribution always obvious choose time windows spatial region data collected example despite name classic P component defined morphology posterior scalp distribution sensitivity particular experimental manipulations precise timing Indeed P effects vary several hundred ms due factors may little theoretical interest given study Kutas McCarthy Donchin components N may stable timing Federmeier Laszlo vary scalp distribution depending precise nature stimuli Holcomb Kounios Anderson West Kutas Federmeier Moreover even identical stimuli used may differences studies precise scalp distribution effect differences individuals populations precise neuroanatomical sources activated structural functional neuroanatomy leading different projections sources scalp surface Thus even researcher wellmotivated clear priori hypothesis wellstudied component amplitude modulated may know advance exact time window spatial ROI best characterize component studies researcher little priori prediction andor effect manifest mean amplitude approach may restrictive make useful analysis impossible Many researchers recognize issue adopted two main methods increasing flexibility still using spatiotemporally averaged ERP data dependent variable Unfortunately however discuss next practices reintroduce problems Type error first way researchers increase flexibility analysis select analysis parameters based visualization data remains fairly common practice discussed extensively Luck Gaspelin introduces significant bias Choosing time window andor spatial ROI based differences observed data essentially equivalent conducting analysis many different time windows regions reporting one produces largest effect Framed way multiple comparisons problem inflation Type error rate obvious many possible analyses actually conducted often called problem implicit multiple comparisons Luck Gaspelin see also Gelman Loken many researchers appear unaware extent inflate Type error rate undermine confidence significant results second way researchers attempted increase flexibility analysis principled nature either spatial regions andor temporal window included additional factors statistical model example electrodes may divided different spatial regions entered repeated measures ANOVA hemisphere factor anteriorposterior factor possible examine main effects experimental conditions interest interaction effects spatial factors approach advantage eliminating need choose spatial region priori discuss next however approach introduces new multiple comparisons problem understand interpret interaction spatial factor type ANOVA important understand biophysical basis EEGERP detailed explanation see Buzski Anastassiou Koch Luck postsynaptic potentials generate ERPs create electrical dipoles generate positive voltage one side particular region cortex corresponding negative voltage side electrode montage scalp covers approximately half full sphere Thus dipole oriented vertically one side recorded electrodes scalp record voltage direction dipole oriented horizontally sides recorded component appear positive deflection sites negative deflection others either case neural source project different weights different electrodes Thus effects composed single dipole composed multiple additive dipoles yield interaction experimental condition electroderegion Moreover since positive negative ends dipole never cancel perfectly across recorded electrodes effects also generate main effect Whether main effect andor interaction effect detected reaches statistical significance simply combination dipole orientation strength discussion interpretation interactions see Luck McCarthy Wood Urbach Kutas Thus inclusion spatial factor ANOVA model gives every effect two independent chances reaching significance multiple spatial factors included problem increases exponentially eg two spatial factors every effect four chances reach significance leads significant inflation Type error rate Although quite common researchers attempt increase flexibility analyses temporal domain measuring multiple time windows including time window factor single repeated measures ANOVA raises similar multiple comparisons concerns addition approach likely low power effects exist one many time windows tested sum face catch analyzing ERP data consistently high power detect effects across space time require flexibility analysis approaches Yet common approaches ERP research allow much flexibility without increasing Type error rate result much damned damned dont aspect choosing time windows spatial regions ERP analysis several methods proposed deal dilemma within traditional spatiotemporal averaging approach Brooks Zoumpoulaki Bowman Luck Gaspelin none wholly satisfactory situations Mass univariate statistics ERP data alternative method dealing implicit multiple comparisons problem ERP data make explicit Rather average across time space calculate separate statistical test multiple time points electrodes individually apply multiple comparisons correction control familywise Type error rate across many independent tests method deals large number dependent variables conducting many univariate analyses referred mass univariate approach key making mass univariate approach practical employ multiple comparisons correction provides adequate power Therefore specialized corrections generally used EEG research two main
